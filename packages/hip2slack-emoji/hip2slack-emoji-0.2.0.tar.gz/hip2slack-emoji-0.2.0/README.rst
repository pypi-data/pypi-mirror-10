hit2slack-emoji
===============

Did you migrate from Hipchat to Slack and now miss the funny emojis?
Your problems are over!

Install
-------

1. We use
   `splinter <http://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__
   to make the browser interactions needed to upload the emojis and as
   we are using only chromedriver for now, you have to first follow
   `these
   instructions <http://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/drivers/chrome.html>`__
   to setup chromedriver in your machine.
2. Make sure to create and activate a Python 3 virtualenv, then type the
   following:

.. code:: bash

    (venv) $ pip install hip2slack-emoji

Run
---

You need thre environment variables: - **SLACK\_TEAM**: your Slack
team's name as in https:/.slack.com/ - **SLACK\_EMAIL**: your Slack
email - **SLACK\_PASS**: your Slack password

So you can run by doing this:

.. code:: bash

    (venv) $ env SLACK_TEAM=yourslackteam SLACK_EMAIL=your@slack.email SLACK_PASS=yourslackpass catchemall

If you want, you can just run:

.. code:: bash

    (venv) $ catchemall

And you will get an interactive prompt asking for Slack info.

Make sure you have permissions in your team to upload emojis.

Enjoy!
