Description: Very early implementation of a Python image watermarker. This was based
        heavily on watermarker (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watermarker/), but
        updated to have a CLI interface and for Python 3.x usage (using Pillow
        instead of PIL).
        
        Far from complete! Pull requests welcome.
