Description: ======
        turnip
        ======
        
        turnip is a flexible and scalable Git server suite written in Python
        using Twisted.
        
        The various servers provide customisable virtual hosting, with flexible
        authentication and authorisation, and individual horizontal scaling from
        the frontend to the storage layer.
        
        None of the Python interfaces here should be considered stable.
        
        
        Architecture
        ------------
        
        turnip's architecture is designed to maximise simplicity, scalability
        and robustness. Each server provides roughly one service, and an
        installation need only run the servers that it desires. Most servers
        eschew local state to ease horizontal scaling, and those that do have
        local state can replicate and/or shard it.
        
        There are two separate server stacks: pack and API. The pack stack
        communicates with Git clients via the pack protocol (git://), smart
        HTTP, or smart SSH. The HTTP and SSH frontends unwrap the tunneled pack
        protocol, and forward it onto the midends as a normal pack protocol
        connection. The separate HTTP API stack provides a programmatic remote
        interface to high-level read and write operations on the repositories
        
        
        Frontends:
         * Pack
         * Smart HTTP
         * Smart SSH
         * HTTP API
        
        Midends:
         * Pack virtualisation
         * API virtualisation
        
        Backends:
         * Pack
         * API
        
        
        Internal protocol
        -----------------
        
        turnip uses an extension of the Git pack protocol for most communication
        between its servers. The only change is that turnip requests can specify
        arbitrary named parameters, not just a hostname.
        
        The relevant part of the Git pack protocol's git-proto-request is
        represented in ABNF as follows:
        
           git-proto-request = request-command SP pathname NUL [ host-parameter NUL ]
           host-parameter = "host=" hostname [ ":" port ]
        
        turnip-proto-request alters it to this:
        
           turnip-proto-request = request-command SP pathname NUL *( param NUL )
           param = param-name "=" param-value
           param-name = *( %x01-3C / %x3E-FF ) ; exclude NUL and =
           param-value = *%x01-FF ; exclude NUL
        
        The only additional parameters implemented today are
        'turnip-stateless-rpc' and 'turnip-advertise-refs', which are used by
        the smart HTTP server to proxy to the standard pack protocol.
        
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Pack smart-http/ssh services can be started with:
        
            python turnipserver.py
        
        The HTTP API can be started with:
        
           make run-api                  
        
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        Turnip is deployed with the turnip juju charm, available from bzr branch lp:~canonical-launchpad-branches/charms/trusty/turnip/devel.
        
        To deploy with the local provider:
        
           juju switch local
           juju bootstrap
           juju deploy --repository=/path/to/loca/charm/repo/root local:trusty/turnip
