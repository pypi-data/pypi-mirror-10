Description: # django-geohashing
        
        A Django application for calculating geohashes and exposing them 
        via RESTful interface. Requires Django 1.8.x+ (takes advantage of
        updated argument parsing for custom management commands, see: 
        [Django 1.8 Release Notes][1] for more information).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install django-geohashing
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        1. Add "geohashing" to your INSTALLED_APPS:
        
            ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
               ...
               'geohashing',
            )
            ```
        
        2. Create the geohashing tables by resyncing your models:
        
            ```bash
            python manage.py migrate
            ```
        
        3. Populate the table using the `get_historical_djia` management command:
        
            ```bash
            python manage.py get_historical_djia --start <date> --end <date>
            ```
        
           The `get_historical_djia` command takes two optional parameters:
           `--start` and `--end`. These parameters accept date strings of the format
           `YY	YY-MM-DD`. They may be used to limit the set of results from
           which to database is populated (so for instance to only retrieve and process 
           only the 30 most recent DJIA openings instead of every opening since 1928).
        
           The parameters are optional but their use is very much encouraged; otherwise 
           tens of thousands of records will be retrieved and imported individually.
        
        4. To expose the geohashing offsets via REST API, include `geohashing.urls` in
           your `urls.py`. Though not strictly required, as a best practice a namespace 
           for the urls should be provided:
        
            ```python
            from django.conf.urls import url
        
            urlpatterns = [
                url(r'^geohashing/', include('geohashing.urls', namespace='geohashing')),
            ]
            ```
        
        ## TODO
        
        This project is still in an extremely early alpha stage. Tasks that still need 
        to be tackled:
        
        - Update the importer to:
        
            - Handle the creation of new Day objects and the update of existing Day 
              objects seperately so that we can use `bulk_create` to improve 
              performance.
            - Extrapolate data points beyond the maximum date when enough information
              is available to do so.
            - Add a `get_current_djia` management command to be used for retrieving
              today's opening value. Occasionally the various sources for the opening 
              value are initially inconsistent with one another. The management command 
              should handle this gracefully by waiting for consensus.
        
        - Add unit tests and docs
        - Run Flake8 against the codebase and fix any glaring PEP-8 violations
        - Set up Continuous Integration...integration
