There are a number of other interesting projects out there which have
some features in common with Palladium. In the following, we will mention a
selection.

- `DOMINO <http://www.dominodatalab.com>`_

  Infrastructure for data analysis (PaaS). A UI for running and
  examining experiments is provided. Experiments can be run in
  parallel and notification mechanisms can be set up. Models can be
  deployed as web services (referring to DOMINO's documentation, the
  overhead for the HTTP server is about 150ms) and model updates can
  be scheduled. Supports Python, R, Julia, Octave, and SAS
  models. Commercial.

- `PredictionIO <http://prediction.io>`_

  ML server based on Hadoop / Spark. Two engine templates for Apache
  Spark MLlib are provided for setting up a recommendation engine or a
  classification engine. It also allows for gathering new
  events. Supports Spark MLlib and Scala models (no support for
  Python, R, Julia). Open source.


- `Scikit-Learn Laboratory
  <https://github.com/EducationalTestingService/skll>`_

  Tool to support experiments performed with scikit-learn. It allows
  to run various settings on different test sets and to get a summary
  of the test's results. It does not aim at exposing models as web
  services. Supports Python models (no support for R or Julia). Open
  source.

- `yhat ScienceOps <http://yhathq.com>`_

  Platform for managing predictive models in production environments
  (PaaS). A command line tool and GUI are available for model
  management. It also provides a Load Balancer and can automatically
  scale the servers as needed. Supports Python and R
  models. Commercial.
