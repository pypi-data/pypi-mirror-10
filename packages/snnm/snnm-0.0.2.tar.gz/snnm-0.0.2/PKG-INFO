        The first problem is for smart people only. The second one can be eased with the aid of snnm (SYNONYMS)
        
        
        ###How it works
        
        The basics:
        
            $ snnm coffee
        	perk
        	mud
        	brew
        	café
        	cappuccino
        	espresso
        	caffeine
        	java
        	decaf
        	decoction
        	mocha
        	demitasse
        	ink
        	battery acid
        	café au lait
        	café noir
        	forty weight
        	hot stuff
        	jamocha
        	joe
        	varnish remover
        
        ... and some variations:
        
        1. Camel case
        
        	    $ snnm coffee --camel-case
        		...
        		CafeAuLait
        		...
        
        2. Mixed case
        
            	$ snnm coffee --mixed-case
        		...
        		cafeAuLait
        		...
        
        3. Underscore
        
            	$ snnm coffee --underscore
        		...
        		cafe_au_lait
        		...
        
        4. Constant
        
        		$ snnm coffee --constant
        		...
        		CAFE_AU_LAIT
        		...
        
        
        
        And that's it. That's all it does... =P
