# fiscalmodel

This package holds reference data (taxonomies) for the classification of fiscal data (government budgets, expenditure reports, and similar). The goal is to provide a simple yet comprehensive way to describe the purpose and contents of a particular dataset with regards to a country's budget process.

This is used by [spendb](https://github.com/pudo/spendb) to structure the navigation and workflow around fiscal data stored within the platform.

For potential dimensions of this classification effort, see:
