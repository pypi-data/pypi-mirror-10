Description: # Readme
        
        **msdiff** is a visual diff tool for [Musescore](https://musescore.org/) `.mscx` files.
        It doesn't work on `.mscz` files yet; keep in mind that using `.mscz` files with
        version control is not yet a very good idea either...
        
        **msdiff** tries to show the user a meaningful diff of the music score, instead of
        a simple textual diff, which is not meaningful to humans.
        
        The diffs are nothing more than Musescore files that combine the two scores
        and highlight the differences. After generating the diff, **msdiff** calls
        musescore on the resulting file, allowing you to inspect the score.
        
        Besides using Musescore to view the diff file, this **msdiff** is
        *completely independent* from Musescore, which means it might have
        problems parsing some files, but I think it is good enough for serious use.
        
        For more, please read the [documentation](http://cryptonomicon314.bitbucket.org/msdiff/documentation.md.html).
