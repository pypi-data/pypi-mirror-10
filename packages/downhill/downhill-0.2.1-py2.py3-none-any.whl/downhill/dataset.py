r'''This module contains a class for handling batched datasets.

In many optimization tasks, parameters must be updated by optimizing them with
respect to estimates of a loss function. The loss function for many problems is
estimated using a set of data that we have measured.

class Dataset:
    '''This class handles batching and shuffling a dataset.

    In ``downhill``, losses are optimized using sets of data collected from the
    problem that generated the loss.

    During optimization, data are grouped into "mini-batches"---that is, chunks
    that are larger than 1 sample and smaller than the entire set of samples;
    typically the size of a mini-batch is between 10 and 100, but the specific
    setting can be varied depending on your model, hardware, dataset, and so
    forth. These mini-batches must be presented to the optimization algorithm in
    pseudo-random order to match the underlying stochasticity assumptions of
    many optimization algorithms. This class handles the process of grouping
    data into mini-batches as well as iterating and shuffling these mini-batches
    dynamically as the dataset is consumed by the optimization algorithm.

    For many tasks, a dataset is obtained as a large block of sample data, which
    in Python is normally assembled as a ``numpy`` ndarray. To use this class on
    such a dataset, just pass in a list or tuple containing ``numpy`` arrays;
    the number of these arrays must match the number of inputs that your loss
    computation requires.

    There are some cases when a suitable set of training data would be
    prohibitively expensive to assemble in memory as a single ``numpy`` array.
    To handle these cases, this class can also handle a dataset that is provided
    via a Python callable. For more information on using callables to provide
    data to your model, see :ref:`data-using-callables`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : ndarray, tuple, list, or callable
        One or more sets of data.

        If this parameter is callable, then mini-batches will be obtained by
        calling the callable with no arguments; the callable is expected to
        return a tuple of ndarrays that will be suitable for optimizing the
        loss at hand.

        If this parameter is a list or tuple, it must contain ndarrays (or
        something similar with a ``shape`` attribute, like a pandas DataFrame).
        These are assumed to contain data for computing the loss; the length of
        this tuple or list should match the number of inputs required by the
        loss computation. If multiple ndarrays are provided, their lengths along
        the axis given by the ``axis`` parameter (defaults to 0) must match.

    name : str, optional
        A string that is used to describe this dataset. Usually something like
        'test' or 'train'.

    batch_size : int, optional
        The size of the mini-batches to create from the data sequences. Defaults
        to 32.

    iteration_size : int, optional
        The number of batches to yield for each call to iterate(). Defaults to
        the length of the data divided by batch_size. If the dataset is a
        callable, then the number is len(callable). If callable has no length,
        then the number is set to 100.

    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to split the data arrays, if the first parameter is
        given as one or more ndarrays. If not provided, defaults to 0.
