        firebrowse: python bindings for the Broad Institute TCGA GDAC FireBrowse Portal.
        
        This module facilitates programmatic interaction with TCGA data and analyses in
        firebrowse.org, through Python and the UNIX command line.  It offers 3 sets of
        features:
        
        1) Low-level object-oriented Python wrappers to the FireBrowse RESTful API.
        Methods in the low level interface by default return 1 page of query results per 
        call, in JSON form. TSV, CSV, and Python dicts may be returned by specifying a 
        suitable format= parameter, and multiple pages may be selected with a suitable 
        page= parameter. See the set_codec() and param_values() functions for more 
        details on these and other parameters.
        
        2) A higher level Python interface that provides simplified access for common
        bioinformatic use cases. For example, objects do not need to be explicitly 
        instantiated and functions by default return all pages of query results per
        call, in TSV format.
        
        3) And the fbget tool, for accessing the high level interface directly from
        the UNIX command line.
