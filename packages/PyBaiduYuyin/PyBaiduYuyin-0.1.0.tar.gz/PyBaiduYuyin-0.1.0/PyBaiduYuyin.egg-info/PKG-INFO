Description: PyBaiduYuyin
        ============
        
        This project is a wrapper for [Baidu Yuyin(voice) API](http://yuyin.baidu.com/)
        
        This project is modified from [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition), which is published under the 3-clause BSD license.
            
        Requirement
        ===========
        
        + PyAudio
        
        This can be installed by `pip`:
        
        ~~~{shell}
        $ sudo pip install pyaudio
        ~~~
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        > Note: I'm still working on this part, contributions are welcomed.
        
        ### TTS (Text-To-Speech)
        
        Details can be found in source code.
        
        Example: 
        
        ~~~{python}
        import PyBaiduYuyin as pby
        tts = pby.TTS(app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY, secret_key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY)
        tts.say("你好")
        ~~~
        
        ### Recognition
        
        The usage of Recognition module is same as [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition), except using `Baidu App Key` and `Baidu Secret Key` instead of `Google App Key`.
        
        Please see [SpeechRecognition's README](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/README.rst) for details.
