# python-syncthing

Python bindings to the Syncthing REST interface. Supports Python 2 and Python 3 (via [six](http://pythonhosted.org//six/)).

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

[Syncthing REST Documentation](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/wiki/REST-Interface)

```bash
pip install syncthing
```

These bindings use Meta classes to create dynamic bindings based on the latest documentation of the Synthing REST API on their github repository.

`GET` methods are returned as a Bunch dot-dictionary, and are bound to the `Syncthing` object as properties. `POST` calls are bound as methods to `Syncthing`,
beginning with the word `set_`, and allow arguments to be passed similarly as they would in the HTTP header.


**WARNING:** python-syncthing uses an offline cache to story the REST API that it retrieves from the parent github. If the python process does not have write privledges
the first time the cache is synced it will fail with a permission error. To remedy this, before running `import syncthing` for the first time, run `sudo python -c "import syncthing"`
from the commandline to pre-cache the api. The REST API version for the targetting Syncthing version will be included by default, however. (v0.11.6)

## Quickstart

```python
from syncthing.interface import get_latest_documentation
from syncthing import Interface, Syncthing

# this will download the REST API markdown from github
# and store it in a cache folder located in syncthing/docs.
# when called explicitly it will update to the newest version
# of the REST API, overwriting the old binding documentation.
# otherwise, the Syncthing meta class will download the latest
# documentation on first run, and use that as its bound version
# until it's explicitly updated.

sync_interface = Interface(
    'my api key',
    host = 'localhost',
    port = 'syncthing port',
    timeout = 5.0,            # seconds
    is_https = False
)

sync = Syncthing(sync_interface)

print(sync.methods)           # prints out the available REST methods

print(sync.warning_methods)   # REST methods that require force=True to perform

print(sync.help('db_browse')) # returns the documentation for a given method

```

### syncthing.Interface

#### Interface(api_key, host='localhost', port=8080, timeout=3.0, is_https=False, ssl_cert_file=None, **kwargs)

#### Interface.root
Returns the connection string given the initialization parameters, ie: `http://localhost:5324`

#### Interface.is_connected
Returns `True` if the Interface can communicate with the Syncthing server, `False` otherwise.

#### Interface.from_dict(d)
Returns an Interface from a dictionary config.

#### Interface.from_json(json_str)
Returns an Interface from a JSON string.

#### Interface.to_json()
Exports Interface configuration as JSON string.
