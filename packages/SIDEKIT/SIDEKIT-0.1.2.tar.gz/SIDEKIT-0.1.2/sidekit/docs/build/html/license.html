<div class="line">Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</div>
<div class="line">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Preamble</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line">software and other kinds of works.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</div>
</div>
<div class="line">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</div>
<div class="line">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</div>
<div class="line">share and change all versions of a program&#8211;to make sure it remains free</div>
<div class="line">software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</div>
<div class="line">any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</div>
<div class="line">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</div>
<div class="line">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</div>
</div>
<div class="line">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</div>
<div class="line">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</div>
<div class="line">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</div>
<div class="line">freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</div>
<div class="line">or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</div>
<div class="line">know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</div>
<div class="line">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For the developers&#8217; and authors&#8217; protection, the GPL clearly explains</div>
</div>
<div class="line">that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#8217; and</div>
<div class="line">authors&#8217; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</div>
<div class="line">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</div>
<div class="line">authors of previous versions.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</div>
</div>
<div class="line">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</div>
<div class="line">can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</div>
<div class="line">protecting users&#8217; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</div>
<div class="line">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</div>
<div class="line">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</div>
<div class="line">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</div>
<div class="line">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</div>
<div class="line">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</div>
<div class="line">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</div>
<div class="line">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</div>
<div class="line">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</div>
<div class="line">make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</div>
<div class="line">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">0. Definitions.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&#8220;This License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&#8220;Copyright&#8221; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</div>
</div>
<div class="line">works, such as semiconductor masks.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&#8220;The Program&#8221; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</div>
</div>
<div class="line">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.  &#8220;Licensees&#8221; and</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;recipients&#8221; may be individuals or organizations.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To &#8220;modify&#8221; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</div>
</div>
<div class="line">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</div>
<div class="line">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &#8220;modified version&#8221; of the</div>
<div class="line">earlier work or a work &#8220;based on&#8221; the earlier work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A &#8220;covered work&#8221; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</div>
</div>
<div class="line">on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To &#8220;propagate&#8221; a work means to do anything with it that, without</div>
</div>
<div class="line">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</div>
<div class="line">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</div>
<div class="line">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</div>
<div class="line">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</div>
<div class="line">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To &#8220;convey&#8221; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</div>
</div>
<div class="line">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</div>
<div class="line">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An interactive user interface displays &#8220;Appropriate Legal Notices&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</div>
<div class="line">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</div>
<div class="line">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</div>
<div class="line">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</div>
<div class="line">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</div>
<div class="line">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. Source Code.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The &#8220;source code&#8221; for a work means the preferred form of the work</div>
</div>
<div class="line">for making modifications to it.  &#8220;Object code&#8221; means any non-source</div>
<div class="line">form of a work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A &#8220;Standard Interface&#8221; means an interface that either is an official</div>
</div>
<div class="line">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</div>
<div class="line">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</div>
<div class="line">is widely used among developers working in that language.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The &#8220;System Libraries&#8221; of an executable work include anything, other</div>
</div>
<div class="line">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</div>
<div class="line">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</div>
<div class="line">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</div>
<div class="line">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</div>
<div class="line">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;Major Component&#8221;, in this context, means a major essential component</div>
<div class="line">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</div>
<div class="line">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</div>
<div class="line">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The &#8220;Corresponding Source&#8221; for a work in object code form means all</div>
</div>
<div class="line">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</div>
<div class="line">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</div>
<div class="line">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#8217;s</div>
<div class="line">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</div>
<div class="line">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</div>
<div class="line">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</div>
<div class="line">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</div>
<div class="line">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</div>
<div class="line">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</div>
<div class="line">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</div>
<div class="line">subprograms and other parts of the work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</div>
</div>
<div class="line">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</div>
<div class="line">Source.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</div>
</div>
<div class="line">same work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">2. Basic Permissions.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</div>
</div>
<div class="line">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</div>
<div class="line">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</div>
<div class="line">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</div>
<div class="line">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</div>
<div class="line">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</div>
<div class="line">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</div>
</div>
<div class="line">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</div>
<div class="line">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</div>
<div class="line">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</div>
<div class="line">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</div>
<div class="line">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</div>
<div class="line">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</div>
<div class="line">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</div>
<div class="line">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</div>
<div class="line">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</div>
</div>
<div class="line">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</div>
<div class="line">makes it unnecessary.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">3. Protecting Users&#8217; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</div>
</div>
<div class="line">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</div>
<div class="line">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</div>
<div class="line">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</div>
<div class="line">measures.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</div>
</div>
<div class="line">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</div>
<div class="line">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</div>
<div class="line">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#8217;s</div>
<div class="line">users, your or third parties&#8217; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</div>
<div class="line">technological measures.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#8217;s source code as you</div>
</div>
<div class="line">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</div>
<div class="line">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</div>
<div class="line">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</div>
<div class="line">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</div>
</div>
<div class="line">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</div>
<div class="line">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</div>
<div class="line">it, and giving a relevant date.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</div>
<div class="line">released under this License and any conditions added under section</div>
<div class="line">7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;keep intact all notices&#8221;.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</div>
<div class="line">License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</div>
<div class="line">License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</div>
<div class="line">additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</div>
<div class="line">regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</div>
<div class="line">permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</div>
<div class="line">invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</div>
<div class="line">Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</div>
<div class="line">interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</div>
<div class="line">work need not make them do so.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</div>
</div>
<div class="line">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</div>
<div class="line">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</div>
<div class="line">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</div>
<div class="line">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#8217;s users</div>
<div class="line">beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</div>
<div class="line">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</div>
<div class="line">parts of the aggregate.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</div>
</div>
<div class="line">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</div>
<div class="line">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</div>
<div class="line">in one of these ways:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div>
<div class="line">(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</div>
<div class="line">customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div>
<div class="line">(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</div>
<div class="line">written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</div>
<div class="line">long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</div>
<div class="line">model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</div>
<div class="line">copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</div>
<div class="line">product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</div>
<div class="line">more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</div>
<div class="line">conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</div>
<div class="line">written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</div>
<div class="line">alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</div>
<div class="line">only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</div>
<div class="line">with subsection 6b.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</div>
<div class="line">place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</div>
<div class="line">further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</div>
<div class="line">copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</div>
<div class="line">may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</div>
<div class="line">that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</div>
<div class="line">clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</div>
<div class="line">available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</div>
<div class="line">you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</div>
<div class="line">Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</div>
<div class="line">charge under subsection 6d.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</div>
</div>
<div class="line">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</div>
<div class="line">included in conveying the object code work.</div>

<div class="line">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</div>

<div class="line">When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</div>
</div>
<div class="line">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</div>
<div class="line">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</div>

<div class="line">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</div>
<div class="line">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</div>
<div class="line">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</div>
<div class="line">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</div>
<div class="line">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</div>
<div class="line">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</div>

<div class="line">8. Termination.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</div>

<div class="line">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</div>

<div class="line">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</div>
<div class="line">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</div>
<div class="line">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</div>
<div class="line">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</div>
<div class="line">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</div>
<div class="line">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="line">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</div>
<div class="line">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</div>
<div class="line">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</div>
<div class="line">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</div>
<div class="line">licenses to the work the party&#8217;s predecessor in interest had or could</div>
<div class="line">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</div>
<div class="line">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</div>
<div class="line">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</div>
<div class="line">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</div>

<div class="line">A contributor&#8217;s &#8220;essential patent claims&#8221; are all patent claims</div>

<div class="line">An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided</div>
</div>
<div class="line">by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.</div>

<div class="line">of using an interface provided by the Library.</div>

<div class="line">A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to</div>

<div class="line">whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of</div>
<div class="line">this License applicable to that copy.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</div>
</div>
<div class="line">a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object</div>
<div class="line">code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated</div>
<div class="line">material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure</div>
<div class="line">layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates</div>
<div class="line">(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</div>
<div class="line">document.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">4. Combined Works.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the</div>
<div class="line">portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of</div>
<div class="line">the following:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that</div>
<div class="line">the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</div>
<div class="line">document.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during</div>
<div class="line">execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among</div>
<div class="line">these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the</div>
<div class="line">copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) Do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this</div>
<div class="line">License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form</div>
<div class="line">suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to</div>
<div class="line">recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of</div>
<div class="line">the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the</div>
<div class="line">manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time</div>
<div class="line">a copy of the Library already present on the user&#8217;s computer</div>
<div class="line">system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version</div>
<div class="line">of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked</div>
<div class="line">Version.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise</div>
<div class="line">be required to provide such information under section 6 of the</div>
<div class="line">GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is</div>
<div class="line">necessary to install and execute a modified version of the</div>
<div class="line">Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the</div>
<div class="line">Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If</div>
<div class="line">you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany</div>
<div class="line">the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application</div>
<div class="line">Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation</div>
<div class="line">Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL</div>
<div class="line">for conveying Corresponding Source.)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">5. Combined Libraries.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Library side by side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this</div>
<div class="line">License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your</div>
<div class="line">choice, if you do both of the following:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,</div>
<div class="line">conveyed under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it</div>
<div class="line">is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the</div>
<div class="line">accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
</div>
<div class="line">of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new</div>
<div class="line">versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</div>
<div class="line">differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version</div>
<div class="line">of the GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that published version or of any later version</div>
<div class="line">published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you</div>
<div class="line">received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</div>
</div>
<div class="line">whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall</div>
<div class="line">apply, that proxy&#8217;s public statement of acceptance of any version is</div>
<div class="line">permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
