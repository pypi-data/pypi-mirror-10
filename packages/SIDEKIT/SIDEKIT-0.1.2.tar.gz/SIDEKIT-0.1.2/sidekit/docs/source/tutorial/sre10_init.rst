Prepare to run experiments on NIST-SRE 2010
===========================================

| Before running experiments on the NIST-SRE 2010 database
| you need to run the script :mod:`sre10_init.py`
| in order to prepare the lists of file and indexes required.
|
| To work, this script only requires you to modify the path
| where the NIST data databases are stored
|
| We assume here that the sphere files from the NIST-SRE have been
| stored in sub-directories of a same directory.
|
| i.e.:
|
| sre_root_directory
|          - sre04
|          - sre05
|          - sre06
|          - sre08
|          - sre10
