        Scell is a MIT-licensed selector library, written in Python.
        
        At the heart of event-driven platforms is the selector, the
        humble **select.select** function. Using it is very simple,
        but requires you to pass in lists of file handles again and
        again. Keeping track of these file handles are tricky. Let
        Scell handle it for you and focus on building an awesome
        library/server::
        
            >>> selector = scell.Selector()
            >>> monitor = selector.register(open('file.txt'), mode='r')
            >>> monitor.callback = lambda: 1
            >>> [event.callback() for event in selector.ready]
            [1]
        
        Scell allows implementors to effortlessly build libraries
        atop of the minimal abstraction provided, while also having
        good performance. The API is very small and works across
        many platforms, including Windows and OSX.
        
        
        Features
