* ``arraybuffer_dsc`` is a type for desciption of buffers for creation of multidimensional arrays and typed memoryviews.

Main repository for ``arraybuffer`` 
is on `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/intellimath/arraybuffer>`_.

There are `example <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/intellimath/arraybuffer/raw/default/examples/arraybuffer.ipynb>`_ and `benchmark <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/intellimath/arraybuffer/raw/default/examples/arraybuffer_benchmarks.ipynb>`_.
