Description: =============
        ABC-Backports
        =============
        
        Usage::
        
            import backports_abc
            backports_abc.patch()
        
            try:
                from collections.abc import Coroutine, Generator
            except ImportError:
                from collections import Coroutine, Generator
        
        Currently provides the following names if missing:
        
        * ``collections.abc.Generator``
        * ``collections.abc.Awaitable``
        * ``collections.abc.Coroutine``
        * ``inspect.isawaitable(obj)``
        
        In Python 2.x, it patches the ``collections`` module instead of the
        ``collections.abc`` module
        
        The names that were previously patched by ``patch()`` can be queried
        through the mapping in ``backports_abc.PATCHED``.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        * removed patching of ``inspect.iscoroutine()`` as it is not ABC based
        
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        * require explicit ``backports_abc.patch()`` call to do the patching
          (avoids side-effects on import and allows future configuration)
        
        * provide access to patched names through global ``PATCHED`` dict
        
        * add ABC based implementations of inspect.iscoroutine() and
          inspect.isawaitable()
        
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * initial public release
        
        * provided ABCs: Generator, Coroutine, Awaitable
