Notes
-----

All functions/classes take only these three arguments:

dd: Day

mm: Month

yy: Year

Dates should be passed as if they were integers. If the Date/Month
contains a “0” before the integer, the “0” should be ommitted.

E.G. DOB “01/01/2000” should be passed as:

dd: 1

mm: 1

yy: 2000
