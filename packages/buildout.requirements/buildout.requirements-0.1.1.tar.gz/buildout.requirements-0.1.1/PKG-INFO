Description: =========================
        buildout.requirements
        =========================
        
        A simple buildout extension that creates a requirements.txt file for pip.
        
        
        This is more or less a copy of buildout.dumprequirements. All credit goes to the authors of that project.
        
        .. warning:: ``buildout.dumppickedversions`` (and therefore also ``buildout.dumprequirements``) does some *nasty*
                     stuff to get its job done. Namely it monkeypatches ``zc.buildout.easy_install._log_requirement``,
                     ``zc.buildout.easy_install.Installer._get_dist`` and ``logging.shutdown``. Because both extensions
                     monkeypatch the same methods, it is currently not possible to use ``buildout.dumppickedversions`` and
                     ``buildout.dumprequirements`` at the same time.
                     I'm not quite sure how to solve this. Probably we'll have to support the functionality of both extensions
                     in one package.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add ``buildout.dumprequirements`` as an extension to the ``[buildout]`` section::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.dumprequirements
            dump-requirements-file = requirements.txt
            overwrite-requirements-file = true
        
        ``dump-requirements-file`` defines the file the requirement list will be written to. If it is undefined the
        package list will be printed to the console. Setting ``overwrite-requirements-file`` to ``false`` will prevent
        ``buildout.dumprequirements`` from overwriting an existing file. The setting defaults to ``true``.
