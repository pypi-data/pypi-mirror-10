Description: FAB! The Forgione-Avent-Barber Finger Pressure Stimulator
        =========================================================
        
        
        
        The Forgione-Avent-Barber (FAB) finger pressure stimulator is a pain stimlation device for use in scientific research.
        
        The FAB updates an original design to allow for indepenent computer control of pressure stimulation of each hand, allowing for a much greater range of experimental designs (e.g. deceptive or conditioned placebo designs).
        
        
        This repository contains the control software for the new device. Full documentation is available online at http://fab-controller.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
