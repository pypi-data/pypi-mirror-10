Description: # PAL (PTA Algorithm Library) #
        
        ## Dependencies ##
        
        Much of the code is still under construction; however, you will need the following 
        to run all of the code in its existing state:
        
        * Python 2.6 or 2.7 (has not been tested with Python 3)
        * Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib
        * [h5py] (http://www.h5py.org)
        * A recent version of [tempo2] (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2/index.php?n=Main.Download)
        * Michele Vallisneri's [libstempo] (https://github.com/vallis/mc3pta/tree/master/stempo)
        * [MultiNest v 2.18 or later] (http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/)
        * [PyMultiNest] (https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest)
        
        We now support the newest version of MultiNest.
        
        ## Goal of PAL ##
        
        This code base is meant to be a collaborative project among members of NANOGrav, EPTA, 
        and PPTA doing gravitational wave data analysis. We strive to give a near complete library
        of existing GW detection and characterization techniques. This code base is heavily centered
        around the Python Programming Language and the hdf5 file format. We also hope to provide users 
        with the ability to simulate many types of fake GW and noise signals for testing of detection
        and characterization algorithms.
        
        This code is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.
