        customer.mlscrcom Installation
        ------------------------------
        
        To install customer.mlscrcom into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
          ``easy_install customer.mlscrcom``. Find out how to install setuptools
          (and EasyInstall) here:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
          via::
        
            python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``customer.mlscrcom-configure.zcml`` in the
          ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
          should only contain this::
        
            <include package="customer.mlscrcom" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``customer.mlscrcom`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                customer.mlscrcom
               
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                customer.mlscrcom
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
