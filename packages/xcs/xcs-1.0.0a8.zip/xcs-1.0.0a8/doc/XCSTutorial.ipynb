    "# XCS Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the official tutorial for the [xcs package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xcs) for Python 3. You can find the latest release and get updates on the project's status at the [project home page](https://github.com/hosford42/xcs) on GitHub.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is XCS?\n",
    "\n",
    "XCS is a Python 3 implementation of the XCS algorithm as described in the 2001 paper, [An Algorithmic Description of XCS](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44640-0_15), by \n",
    "[Martin Butz](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/cognitive-modeling/staff/staff/martin-v-butz.html) and [Stewart Wilson](http://prediction-dynamics.com/). XCS is a type of [Learning Classifier System (LCS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system), a [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) algorithm that utilizes a [genetic algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) acting on a rule-based system, to solve a [reinforcement learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its canonical form, XCS accepts a fixed-width string of bits as its input, and attempts to select the best action from a predetermined list of choices using an evolving set of rules that match inputs and offer appropriate suggestions. It then receives a reward signal indicating the quality of its decision, which it uses to adjust the rule set that was used to make the decision. This process is subsequently repeated, allowing the algorithm to evaluate the changes it has already made and further refine the rule set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of XCS is that, unlike many other machine learning algorithms, it not only learns the optimal input/output mapping, but also produces a minimal set of rules for describing that mapping. This is a big advantage over other learning algorithms such as [neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) whose models are largely opaque to human analysis, making XCS an important tool in any data scientist's tool belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XCS library provides not only an implementation of the standard XCS algorithm, but a set of interfaces which together constitute a framework for implementing and experimenting with other LCS variants. Future plans for the XCS library include continued expansion of the tool set with additional algorithms, and refinement of the interface to support reinforcement learning algorithms in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Being both a reinforcement learning algorithm and an evolutionary algorithm, XCS requires an understanding of terms pertaining to both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Situation\n",
    "A situation is just another term for an input received by the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action\n",
    "An action is an output produced by the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule\n",
    "A rule is a pairing between a condition, describing which situations can be matched, and a suggested action. Each rule has an associated prediction indicating the expected reward if the suggested action is taken when the condition matches the situation, a fitness indicating its suitability for reproduction and continued use in the population, and a numerosity value which indicates the number of (virtual) instances of the rule in the population. (There are other parameters associated with each rule, as well, but these are visibly important ones.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Population\n",
    "This is the collection of all rules currently used and tracked by the classifier. The genetic algorithm operates on this set of rules over time to optimize them for accuracy and generality in their descriptiveness of the problem space. Note that the population is virtual, meaning that if the same rule has multiple copies in the population, it is represented only once, with an associated numerosity value to indicate the number of virtual instances of the rule in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match Set\n",
    "The match set is the set of rules which match against the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Set\n",
    "The action set is the set of rules which match against the current situation and recommend the selected action. Thus the action set is a subset of the match set. In fact, the match set can be seen as a collection of mutually exclusive and competing action sets, from which only one is to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward\n",
    "The reward is the signal the algorithm attempts to maximize. It takes the form of a floating point value passed to the action set via the `accept_payoff()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction\n",
    "A prediction is an estimate by a rule or an action set as to the reward expected to be received by taking the suggested action in the given situation. The prediction of an action set is formed by taking the fitness-weighted average of the predictions made by the individual rules within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fitness\n",
    "Fitness is another floating point value similar in function to the reward, except that in this case it is an internal signal defined by the algorithm itself, which is then used as a guide for selection of which rules are to act as parents to the next generation. Each rule in the population has its own associated fitness value. In XCS, as opposed to strength-based LCS variants such as ZCS, the fitness is actually based on the accuracy of each rule's reward prediction, as opposed to its size. Thus a rule with a very low expected reward can have a high fitness provided it is accurate in its prediction of low reward, whereas a rule with very high expected reward may have low fitness because the reward it receives varies widely from one reward cycle to the next. Using reward prediction accuracy instead of reward prediction size helps XCS find rules that describe the problem in a stable, predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `xcs`, you will of course need a Python 3 interpreter. The latest version of the standard CPython distribution is [available for download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from the Python Software Foundation, or if you prefer a download that comes with a long list of top-notch machine learning and scientific computing packages already built for you, I recommend [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34) from Continuum Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Python 3.4, the standard CPython distribution comes with the package installation tool, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), as part of the standard distribution. Anaconda comes with `pip` regardless of the Python version. If you have `pip`, installation of `xcs` is straight forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install xcs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes as planned, you should see a message like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Successfully installed xcs-1.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you are unable to use `pip`, you can still install `xcs` manually. The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/hosford42/xcs/releases) or [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xcs). Download the zip file, unpack it, and cd into the directory. Then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a message indicating that the package was successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you also install `numpy` if you are using a Python distribution that does not come with it already installed. The `xcs` package will still work without `numpy`, but you should expect slower execution speeds. To install `numpy` with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instructions on how to manually install numpy, visit the [numpy installation instructions page](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) at SciPy.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing the Newly Installed Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start things off with a quick test, to verify that everything has been installed properly. First, fire up the Python interpreter. We'll set up Python's built-in logging system so we can see the test's progress."
