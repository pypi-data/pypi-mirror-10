# We have two different implementations of BitString, one in _fast_bitstrings and one in _slow_bitstrings. The fast
# version is dependent on numpy being installed, whereas the slow one is written in pure Python with no external
# dependencies. This attempts to load the fast version and, failing that, falls back on the slower one.

class BitCondition:
    """A pair of bit strings, one indicating the bit values, and the other indicating the bit mask, which together act
    as a matching template for bit strings. Like bit strings, bit conditions are hashable and immutable. Think of
    BitConditions as patterns which can match against BitStrings of the same length. At each index, we can have a 1,
    a 0, or a #. If the value is 1 or 0, the BitString must have the same value at that index. If the value is #, the
    BitString can have any value at that index.

    BitConditions are matched against BitStrings in one of two ways:
        Method 1:
            result = condition // bitstring
            # result now contains a new BitString which contains a 1 for each position that violated the pattern, and
            # a 0 for each position that did not. This tells us exactly where the condition and the bitstring disagree
        Method 2:
            result = condition(bitstring)
            # result now contains a single Boolean value which is True if the bitstring fully satisfies the pattern
            # specified by the condition, or False if the bitstring disagrees with the condition at at least one index

    BitConditions can also match against other BitConditions in the same way that they are matched against BitStrings,
    with the sole exception that if the condition being used as the pattern specifies a 1 or 0 at a particular index,
    and the condition being used as the substrate contains an # at that point, the match fails.
