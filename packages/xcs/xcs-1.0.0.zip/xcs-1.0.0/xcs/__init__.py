Accuracy-based Classifier Systems for Python 3

This module implements the XCS (Accuracy-based Classifier System)
algorithm, as described in the 2001 paper, "An Algorithmic Description of
XCS," by Martin Butz and Stewart Wilson.[1] The module also provides a
framework for implementing and experimenting with learning classifier
systems in general.

Usage:
    import logging
    from xcs import XCSAlgorithm
    from xcs.scenarios import MUXProblem, ScenarioObserver

    # Create a scenario instance, either by instantiating one of the
    # predefined scenarios provided in xcs.scenarios, or by creating your
    # own subclass of the xcs.scenarios.Scenario base class and
    # instantiating it.
    scenario = MUXProblem(training_cycles=50000)

    # If you want to log the process of the run as it proceeds, set the
    # logging level with the built-in logging module, and wrap the
    # scenario with an OnLineObserver.
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    scenario = ScenarioObserver(scenario)

    # Instantiate the algorithm and set the parameters to values that are
    # appropriate for the scenario. Calling help(XCSAlgorithm) will give
    # you a description of each parameter's meaning.
    algorithm = XCSAlgorithm()
    algorithm.exploration_probability = .1
    algorithm.do_ga_subsumption = True
    algorithm.do_action_set_subsumption = True

    # Create a classifier set from the algorithm, tailored for the
    # scenario you have selected.
    model = algorithm.new_model(scenario)

    # Run the classifier set in the scenario, optimizing it as the
    # scenario unfolds.
    model.run(scenario, learn=True)

    # Use the built-in pickle module to save/reload your model for reuse.
    import pickle
    pickle.dump(model, open('model.bin', 'wb'))
    reloaded_model = pickle.load(open('model.bin', 'rb'))

    # Or just print the results out.
    print(model)

    # Or get a quick list of the best classifiers discovered.
    for rule in model:
        if rule.fitness <= .5 or rule.experience < 10:
            continue
        print(rule.condition, '=>', rule.action, ' [%.5f]' % rule.fitness)


A quick explanation of the XCS algorithm:

    The XCS algorithm attempts to solve the reinforcement learning
    problem, which is to maximize a reward signal by learning the optimal
    mapping from inputs to outputs, where inputs are represented as
    sequences of bits and outputs are selected from a finite set of
    predetermined actions. It does so by using a genetic algorithm to
    evolve a competing population of classifier rules, of the form

        condition => action => prediction

    where the condition is a bit template (a string of 1s, 0s, and
    wildcards, represented as #s) which matches against one or more
    possible inputs, and the prediction is a floating point value that
    indicates the observed reward level when the condition matches the
    input and the indicated action is selected. The fitness of each rule in
    the classifier set is determined not by the size of the prediction, but
    by its observed accuracy, as well as by the degree to which the rule
    fills a niche that many other rules do not already fill. The reason for
    using accuracy rather than reward is that it was found that using r
    eward destabilizes the population.

        argument should be a ClassifierRule instance. The behavior of this
        method depends on whether the rule already exists in the
        classifier set. When a rule is already present, the rule's
        numerosity is added to that of the version of the rule already
        present in the population. Otherwise, the new rule is captured.
        Note that this means that for rules already present in the
        classifier set, the metadata of the existing rule is not
        overwritten by that of the one passed in as an argument.

class XCSAlgorithm(LCSAlgorithm):
    """The XCS algorithm. This class defines how a classifier set is
    managed by the XCS algorithm to optimize for expected reward and
    descriptive brevity. There are numerous parameters which can be
    modified to control the behavior of the algorithm:

        accuracy_coefficient (default: .1, range: (0, 1])
            Affects the size of the "cliff" between measured accuracies of
            inaccurate versus accurate classifiers. A smaller value results
            in a larger "cliff". The default value is good for a wide array
            of scenarios; only modify this if you know what you are doing.

        accuracy_power (default: 5, range: (0, +inf))
            Affects the rate at which measured accuracies of inaccurate
            classifiers taper off. A larger value results in more rapid
            decline in accuracy as prediction error rises. The default
            value is good for a wide array of scenarios; only modify this
            if you know what you are doing.

        crossover_probability (default: .75, range: [0, 1])
            The probability that crossover will be applied to the selected
            parents in a GA selection step. The default value is good for a
            wide array of scenarios.

        deletion_threshold (default: 20, range: [0, +inf))
            The minimum experience of a classifier before its fitness is
            considered in its probability of deletion in a GA deletion
            step. The higher the value, the longer new classifiers are
            given to optimize their reward predictions before being held
            accountable.

        discount_factor (default: .71, range: [0, 1))
            The rate at which future expected reward is discounted before
            being added to the current reward to produce the payoff value
            that is used to update classifier parameters such as reward
            prediction, error, and fitness. Larger values produce more far-
            sighted behavior; smaller values produce more hedonistic
            behavior. For scenarios in which the current action does not
            affect future rewards beyond the current step, set this to 0.
            For scenarios in which actions do affect rewards beyond the
            immediate iteration, set this to higher values. Do not set this
            to 1 as it will produce undefined behavior.

        do_action_set_subsumption (default: False, range: {True, False})
            Subsumption is the replacement of a classifier with another
            classifier, already existing in the classifier set, which is a
            generalization of it and is considered accurate. (See notes
            on the error_threshold parameter.) This parameter determines
            whether subsumption is applied to action sets after they are
            selected and receive a payoff.

        do_ga_subsumption (default: False, range: {True, False})
            Subsumption is the replacement of a classifier with another
            classifier, already existing in the classifier set, which is a
            generalization of it and is considered accurate. (See notes on
            the error_threshold parameter.) This parameter controls whether
            subsumption is applied to eliminate newly added classifiers in
            a GA selection step.

        error_threshold (default: .01, range: [0, maximum reward])
            Determines how much prediction error is tolerated before a
            classifier is classified as inaccurate. This parameter is
            typically set to approximately 1% of the expected range of
            possible rewards received for each action. A range of [0, 1]
            for reward is assumed, and the default value is calculated as
            1% of 1 - 0, or .01. If your scenario is going to have a
            significantly wider or narrower range of potential rewards, you
            should set this parameter appropriately for that range.

        exploration_probability (default: .5, range: [0, 1])
            The probability of choosing a random, potentially suboptimal
            action from the suggestions made by the match set rather than
            choosing an optimal one. It is advisable to set this above 0
            for all scenarios to ensure that the reward predictions
            converge. For scenarios in which on-line performance is
            important, set this value closer to 0 to focus on optimizing
            reward. For scenarios in which the final expression of the
            solution in terms of the evolved population of classifiers is
            of greater significance than optimizing on-line reward, set
            this to a larger value.

        exploration_strategy (default: None,
                              range: ActionSelectionStrategy instances)
            If this is set, exploration_probability will be ignored and the
            action selection strategy provided will be used. (This is not a
            canonical parameter of the XCS algorithm.)

        fitness_threshold (default: .1, range: [0, 1])
            The fraction of the mean fitness of the population below which
            a classifier's fitness is considered in its probability of
            deletion in a GA deletion step.

        ga_threshold (default: 35, range: [0, +inf))
            Determines how often the genetic algorithm is applied to an
            action set. The average time since each classifier in the
            action set last participated in a GA step is computed and
            compared against this threshold; if the value is higher than
            the threshold, the GA is applied. Set this value higher to
            apply the GA less often, or lower to apply it more often.

        idealization_factor (default: 0, range: [0, 1])
            When payoff is computed, the expected future reward is
            multiplied by discount_factor and added to the actual reward
            before being passed to the action set. This makes XCS a member
            of the TD (temporal differences) family of reinforcement
            learning algorithms. There are two major subfamilies of
            algorithms for TD-based reinforcement learning, called SARSA
            and Q-learning, which estimate expected future rewards
            differently. SARSA uses the prediction of the action selected
            for execution on the next step as its estimate, even on
            exploration steps, while Q-learning uses the highest prediction
            of any of the candidate actions in an attempt to eliminate the
            negative bias introduced by exploration steps in learning the
            optimal action. Each strategy has is pros and cons. The
            idealization_factor parameter allows for mixtures of these two
            approaches, with 0 representing a purely SARSA-like approach
            and 1 representing a purely Q-learning-like approach. (This is
            not a canonical parameter of the XCS algorithm.)

        initial_error (default: .00001, range: (0, +inf))
            The value used to initialize the error parameter in the
            metadata for new classifier rules. It is recommended that this
            value be a positive number close to zero. The default value is
            good for a wide variety of scenarios.

        initial_fitness (default: .00001, range: (0, +inf))
            The value used to initialize the fitness parameter in the
            metadata for new classifier rules. It is recommended that this
            value be a positive number close to zero. The default value is
            good for a wide variety of scenarios.

        initial_prediction (default: .00001, range: [0, +inf))
            The value used to initialize the reward prediction in the
            metadata for new classifier rules. It is recommended that this
            value be a number slightly above the minimum possible reward
            for the scenario. It is assumed that the minimum reward is 0;
            if your scenario's minimum reward is significantly different,
            this value should be set appropriately.

        learning_rate (default: .15, range: (0, 1))
            The minimum update rate for time-averaged classifier rule
            parameters. A small non-zero value is recommended.

        max_population_size (default: 200, range: [1, +inf))
            The maximum number of classifiers permitted in the classifier
            set's population. A larger population may converge to a better
            solution and reach a higher level of performance faster, but
            will take longer to converge to an optimal classifier set.

        minimum_actions (default: None, range: [1, +inf))
            The minimum number of actions required in a match set, below
            which covering occurs. (Covering is the random generation of a
            classifier that matches the current situation.) When this is
            set to None, the number of possible actions dictated by the
            scenario is used. If this is set to a value greater than that,
            covering will occur on every step no matter
            what.

        mutation_probability (default: .03, range: [0, 1])
            XCS operates on bit-strings as its input values, and uses bit-
            conditions which act as templates to match against those bit-
            strings. This parameter represents the probability of a
            mutation at any location along the condition, converting a
            wildcard to a non- wildcard or vice versa, in the condition of
            a new classifier generated by the genetic algorithm. Each
            position in the bit condition is evaluated for mutation
            independently of the others.

        subsumption_threshold (default: 20, range: [0, +inf))
            The minimum experience of a classifier before it can subsume
            another classifier. This value should be high enough that the
            accuracy measure has had time to converge.

        wildcard_probability (default: .33, range: [0, 1])
            The probability of any given bit being a wildcard in the
            conditions of the randomly generated classifiers produced
            during covering. If this value is too low, it can cause
            perpetual churn in the population as classifiers are displaced
            by new ones with a low probability of matching future
            situations. If it is too high, it can result in the sustained
            presence of overly general classifiers in the classifier set.
