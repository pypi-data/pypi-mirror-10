Implements the XCS (Accuracy-based Classifier System) algorithm,
roughly according to the description provided in the paper, "An
Algorithmic Description of XCS," by Martin Butz and Stewart Wilson.

Butz, M. and Wilson, S. (2001). An algorithmic description of XCS. In Lanzi, P.,
    Stolzmann, W., and Wilson, S., editors, Advances in Learning Classifier Systems:

    Artificial Intelligence, pages 253–272. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.


A quick explanation of the XCS algorithm:
    The XCS algorithm attempts to solve the reinforcement learning problem, which is to maximize a reward signal by
    learning the optimal mapping from inputs to outputs, where inputs are represented as sequences of bits and
    outputs are selected from a finite set of predetermined actions. It does so by using a genetic algorithm to
    evolve a population of rules of the form

        condition => action => prediction

    where the condition is a bit template (a string of 1s, 0s, and wildcards, represented as #s) which matches
    against one or more inputs, and the prediction is a floating point value that indicates the observed
    reward level when the condition matches the input and the indicated action is selected. The fitness of
    each rule in the population is determined not by the size of the prediction, but by its observed accuracy,
    as well as by the degree to which the rule fills a niche that many other rules do not already fill. The
    reason for using accuracy rather than reward is that it was found that using reward destabilizes the
    population.

# TODO: Finish refactoring the code to isolate the algorithm-specific code from the algorithm-agnostic code. When all
#       is said and done, we should be able to implement a new algorithm with minimal effort or rewritten code, and
#       zero change to the interface.

# TODO: Clean up docstrings and comments with obsolete references to pre-refactoring code.
