The functions and classes in the `humanfriendly` package can be used to make
text interfaces more user friendly. Some example features:

- Parsing and formatting numbers, file sizes, pathnames and timespans in
  simple, human friendly formats.

- Easy to use timers for long running operations, with human friendly
  formatting of the resulting timespans.

- Prompting the user to select a choice from a list of options by typing the
  option's number or a unique substring of the option.

- Terminal interaction including text styling (ANSI escape sequences), user
  friendly rendering of usage messages and querying the terminal for its
  size.

The `humanfriendly` package is currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and
PyPy.

Getting started
---------------

It's very simple to start using the `humanfriendly` package::

   >>> user_input = raw_input("Enter a readable file size: ")
   Enter a readable file size: 16G
   >>> num_bytes = humanfriendly.parse_size(user_input)
   >>> print num_bytes
   17179869184
   >>> print "You entered:", humanfriendly.format_size(num_bytes)
   You entered: 16 GB
