	'''
	Management of the process of sending, recieving, reading, and editing emails.
	
	Note: the get and set methods are technically superflous. You can get more through control over
	a message you are trying to craft throught he use of editing the message.json, but these
	methods provide an easy way if you don't need all the power and would like the ease.
	
	Methods:
		constructor -- creates a new message class, using json for existing, nothing for new.
		fetchAttachments -- kicks off the process that downloads attachments.
		sendMessage -- take local variables and form them to send the message.
		markAsRead -- marks the analougs message in the cloud as read.
		getSender -- gets a dictionary with the sender's information.
		getSenderEmail -- gets the email address of the sender.
		getSenderName -- gets the name of the sender, if possible.
		getSubject -- gets the email's subject line.
		getBody -- gets contents of the body of the email.
		addRecipient -- adds a person to the recipient list.
		setRecipients -- sets the list of recipients.
		setSubject -- sets the subject line.
		setBody -- sets the body.

	Variables: 
		att_url -- url for requestiong attachments. takes message GUID
		send_url -- url for sending an email
		update_url -- url for updating an email already existing in the cloud.
