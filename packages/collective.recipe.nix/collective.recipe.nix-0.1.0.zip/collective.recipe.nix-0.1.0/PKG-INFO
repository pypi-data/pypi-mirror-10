        =====================
        
        This is an experimental buildout recipe for creating nix expression from
        a buildout eggs list. This is work in progress. Please, contribute_.
        
        .. _contribute: https://github.com/datakurre/collective.recipe.nix
        
        **This only works, for now, when all packages are available at PyPI.**
        
        Example of usage
        ----------------
        
        At first, define ``./default.nix`` with buildout::
        
            with import <nixpkgs> {}; {
              myEnv = stdenv.mkDerivation {
                name = "myEnv";
                buildInputs = [
                  pythonPackages.readline
                  pythonPackages.buildout
                ];
                shellHook = ''
                  export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.nix-profile/etc/ca-bundle.crt
                '';
              };
            }
        
        And example ``./buildout.cfg``:
        
        .. code:: cfg
        
            [buildout]
            extends = https://dist.plone.org/release/4-latest/versions.cfg
            parts =
                plone
                zest.releaser
            develop = .
            versions = versions
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            eggs =
                Plone
                plone.recipe.zope2instance
            user = admin:admin
        
            [plone]
            recipe = collective.recipe.nix
            eggs = ${instance:eggs}
        
            [zest.releaser]
            recipe = collective.recipe.nix
            eggs = zest.releaser
        
            [versions]
            zc.buildout =
            setuptools =
        
        Run the buildout:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell --run buildout
        
        Now you should be able to run zest.releaser with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell zest.releaser.nix --run fullrelease
        
        And launching python with all Plone dependencies with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell plone.nix --run python
        
        And Plone could be started by entering the following lines into the
        interpreter:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import plone.recipe.zope2instance.ctl
            plone.recipe.zope2instance.ctl.main(['-C', 'parts/instance/etc/zope.conf', 'fg'])
