Description: This is a Blogofile_ plugin that implements a basic blog engine.
        
        .. _Blogofile: http://www.blogofile.com/
        
        It provides a collection of Mako template files along with CSS and ancillary
        files,
        all derived from the HTML5Boilerplate project.
        It also provided Blogofile_ configuration, controllers, filters, and commands
        to allow you to create a simple blog engine that requires no database
        and no special hosting environment.
        
        The templates include features like:
        
        * Custom `web fonts from Google`_
        * Disqus_ comments
        * `Google Analytics`_ tracking code stub
        * seaofclouds_ jQuery twitter plugin
        
        .. _web fonts from Google: http://www.google.com/webfonts/
        .. _Disqus: http://disqus.com/
        .. _Google Analytics: http://www.google.com/analytics/
        .. _seaofclouds: http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/
        
        Use them or remove them as you wish.
        
        There's also a few sample posts to show off:
        
        * Syntax highlighting for code snippets
        * Unicode support
        * Basic Markdown syntax
        
        Customize the Mako templates,
        create posts in reStructuredText, Markdown, or Textile, (or even plain HTML)
        and blogofile generates your entire blog as
        plain HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, and Atom/RSS feeds
        which you can then upload to any old web server you like.
        No database.
        No CGI or scripting environment on the server.
        Just fast, secure static content!
        
        Take a look at the blogofile `project docs`_ for a quick-start guide,
        and detailed usage instructions.
        
        Or create a virtualenv and dive right in with::
        
          pip install -U blogofile
          pip install -U blogofile_blog

        =====
        
        If you've been using the blogofile_blog code from GitHub but haven't
        updated in a while you should take note of the following.
        
        Breaking Changes
        ----------------
        
        - Functions in the ``blogofile.util`` module can now only be accessed in
          templates via the ``bf.util`` namespace; e.g. ``bf.util.site_path_helper()``.
          Accessing util functions via ``bf.config.util`` no longer works.
          It is unknown how widespread the use of ``bf.config.util`` is,
          but at least 2 in-the-wild occurrences were found and corrected in
          the ``blogofile.com`` site source files.
        
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - Fix an issue with the template lookup order whereby user's templates
          failed to override plugin ``site_src`` template of the same name.
          See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile_blog/issues/13
        
        - Fix Python 2 handling of utf-8 encoded content in posts.
          See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile_blog/pull/10.
        
        - Fix disabling of Disqus comments on permalink page.
          See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile_blog/pull/9.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - The codebase has been unified for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 (no 2to3 or
          3to2 conversion required).
        
        - No longer dependent on a version of the ``argparse`` library bundled
          with blogofle. ``argparse`` is included in the standard library for
          Python 2.7 and 3.2+. ``setup.py`` will install it from PyPI for Python
          2.6, 3.0, and 3.1.
