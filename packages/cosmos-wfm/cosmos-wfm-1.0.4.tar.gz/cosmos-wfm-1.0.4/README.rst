**COSMOS** is a Python library for workflow management that allows formal description of pipelines and partitioning of jobs.
In addition, it includes a user-interface for tracking the progress of jobs, abstraction of the queuing system and fine-grained control over the workflow.
Workflows can be created on traditional computing clusters as well as cloud-based services.
It is developed jointly by the `Laboratory for Personalized Medicine <http://lpm.hms.harvard.edu>`_ at Harvard Medical School,
the `Wall Lab <http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/>`_ at Stanford University, and `Invitae <http://invitae.com>`_.

COSMOS was officially published as a
`manuscript <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/29/bioinformatics.btu385>`_,
but has evolved a lot since it's original inception.  If you use COSMOS
for research, please cite it's `manuscript <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/29/bioinformatics.btu385>`_.  This means a lot to the author.

COSMOS is currently BETA.  Although the code is considered stable,
we are planning a major publication before the official release.
