        Why?
        ====
        
        When building commandline utilities the syntax ``--arg key=val`` is useful,
        especially when ``key`` and ``val`` will be used as ``Class(key=val)`` internally.
        This module was built specifically to be used with the CLI framework `click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`_, and the
        included extensions play nicely, but the ``str2type.str2type()`` function can be
        used elsewhere.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        See the ``examples`` directory for `click integration examples <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click>`_.  Everything else is primarily handled
        by a single function:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from str2type import str2type
            >>> print(str2type("1.23"))
            1.23
            >>> print(str2type("1.")
            1.0
            >>> print(str2type(".2"))
            0.2
            >>> print(str2type("None"))
            None
            >>> print(str2type('String'))
            'String'
        
        
        Supported Types
        ===============
        
        Only the standard builtin Python types plus JSON strings are supported:
        
        - ``int``
        - ``float``
        - ``None``
        - ``True``
        - ``False``
        - ``JSON``
        
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
