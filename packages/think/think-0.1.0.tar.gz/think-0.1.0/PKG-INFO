Description: Terminal Think Music
        ====================
        
        Are you executing a process that takes a long time?  Do you want to know that it’s
        still working while you are in another terminal/making coffee?  Do you have a
        favorite game show tune to play while doing something?
        
        If yes: ``think`` is just for you.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Create a file named ``~/.config/think.conf`` (or wherever your ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is) with the following four lines::
        
            [Think]
            command = play
            file = /home/kwpolska/Dropbox/Media/Wielka Gra.mp3
            behavior = wait
        
        * ``command`` is the command of the player that will be executed.  You can use
          ``play`` (from ``sox``) or any other fast CLI music player.
        * ``file`` is the filename that will be given as the sole argument to the play command. No escaping is necessary. I’m using the `Wielka Gra <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnu7I3b7ZbY>`__ theme, Americans might want `Jeopardy! Think Music <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXGhvoekY44>`__ (also the namesake for this command), Brits might want the `Countdown theme <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dhD9zR6hk>`__.
        * ``behavior`` can be one of:
        
          * ``return`` — return control to the terminal as soon as the program finishes, without stopping the music
          * ``wait`` — wait until music stops before returning control
          * ``stop`` — stop the music and return control immediately
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Prepend ``think`` before the command that takes long::
        
            think sleep 120
