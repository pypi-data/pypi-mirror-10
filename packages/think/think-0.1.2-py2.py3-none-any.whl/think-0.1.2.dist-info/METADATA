Terminal Think Music
====================

Are you executing a process that takes a long time?  Do you want to know that it’s
still working while you are in another terminal/making coffee?  Do you have a
favorite game show tune to play while doing something?

If yes: ``think`` is just for you.

Installation
------------

You can install ``think`` from PyPI (with ``pip install think``). Arch Linux
users can install the ``think`` package from the AUR.

Configuration
-------------

Create a file named ``~/.config/think.conf`` (or wherever your ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is) with the following four lines::

    [Think]
    command = play
    file = /home/kwpolska/Dropbox/Media/Wielka Gra.mp3
    behavior = wait

* ``command`` is the command of the player that will be executed.  You can use
  ``play`` (from ``sox``) or any other fast CLI music player.
* ``file`` is the filename that will be given as the sole argument to the play command. No escaping is necessary. I’m using the `Wielka Gra <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnu7I3b7ZbY>`__ theme, Americans might want `Jeopardy! Think Music <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXGhvoekY44>`__ (also the namesake for this command), Brits might want the `Countdown theme <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dhD9zR6hk>`__.
* ``behavior`` can be one of:

  * ``return`` — return control to the terminal as soon as the program finishes, without stopping the music
  * ``wait`` — wait until music stops before returning control
  * ``stop`` — stop the music and return control immediately

Usage
-----

Prepend ``think`` before the command that takes too long to execute::

    think sleep 120
