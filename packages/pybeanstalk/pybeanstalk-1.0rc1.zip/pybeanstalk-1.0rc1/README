A client library for beanstalkd. beanstalkd is a lightweight job queuing daemon
based on libevent. It is meant to be used across multiple systems, and takes
inspiration from memcache. More details on beanstalk can be found at:
http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/

This client library aims to be simple and extensible. It provides both a single thread,
single connection serialized (select-based) beanstalk connection with optional, simple
thread pool implementation, and a basic Twisted client. They can be used directly,
or be used as basis for for more sophisticated client applications. Please see
the examples directory for usage examples.

To install, just run python setup.py install from this directory. For the Twisted client,
install the 'twisted' extra (python setup.py install [twisted]).

Please see the examples directory for usage examples.
