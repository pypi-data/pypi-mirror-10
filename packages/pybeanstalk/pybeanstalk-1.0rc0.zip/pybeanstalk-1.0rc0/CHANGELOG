1.0rc0 -- July 7, 2015:
 * reorganization at GitHub
 * first-ever PyPI release
 * switch to setuptools from distutils
 * initial tests for Twisted client (see wiki > testing)
 * several bug fixes
 * abandon beanstalkd-tracking version numbering, follow PEP440

0.11.1 -- May 6, 2008:
 * made the poller timeout code into an debugging option (severconn._debug=True)
 * moved example.py from the main beanstalk package to the examples/ directory
 * renamed example.py to simple_clients.py
 * removed producer.py since that functionality was handled in simple_clients
 * fixed some bugs in the Job class, it should be usable now.

0.11.0 -- Apr. 19, 2008:
 * changes below incorporated
 * skipping 0.10.0 since 0.11.0 came out right away, and the versions are
   compatable/interchangable, with the exeption of a couple of the stats. I'd
   suggest that you dont rely on those stats if you may use code on both :) see
   beanstalk's proto.txt for more info on that.

Apr. 19, 2008:
 * Updates for 0.10/0.11 versions of beanstalkd.
   * protocol changes are incorporated
   * testing is expanded to cover this
 * Cleanup:
   * protohandler.py changed handler from a pure generator to a class. It improves
     performance slightly, and more importantly makes things cleaner to read.
   * removed some superfluous code from __init__.py
   * better comments
 * New stuff:
   * examples directory. This will, over time, accrue example uses/simple cases
     of using pybeanstalk
   * libevent support. Added a new connection type that works with libevent and
     pyevent. This connection type will only import on systems with pyevet
     installed.

0.9.0 -- Mar. 20, 2008:
 * new tests for everything
 * added connection level support for tubes
 * changed the ServerConn class to be less verbose, using __getattr__
 * Implemented the 0.9 protocol
 * The handler function for interactions is now a generator and the whole of
   it is implemented in a continuation passing style
 * Moved protohandler from a class to functions.

0.7.0 -- Mar. 23, 2008
 * Fixed a typo pointed out by Keith Rarick
 * fixed some text formatting issues.
Feb. 21, 2008:
 * This is the first alpha release of this client software, changelog will
   be implemented from here.
