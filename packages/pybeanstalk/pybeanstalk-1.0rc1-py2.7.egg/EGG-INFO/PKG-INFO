Description: 
        A pure-Python client library for beanstalkd. beanstalkd is a lightweight queuing daemon
        based on libevent. It is meant to be used across multiple systems, and takes
        inspiration from memcache. More details on beanstalk can be found at:
        http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/
        
        This client library aims to be simple and extensible. It provides both a single thread,
        single connection serialized (select-based) beanstalk connection with optional, simple
        thread pool implementation, and a basic Twisted client. Both can be used directly, or
        be used as basis for for more sophisticated client applications. Please see the examples
        directory for usage examples.
        
        To install, just run python setup.py install from this directory, or use the shortcuts
        in the Makefile. For Twisted support, run install with the 'twisted' extra.
