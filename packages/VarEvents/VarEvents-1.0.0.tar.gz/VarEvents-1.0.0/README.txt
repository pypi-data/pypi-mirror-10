VarEvents

Event raising variables.

VarEvents is is a Python module that provides a 
lightweight solution for responding to changes 
in variable values. It allows event handlers to 
subscribe to variable events.

Out of the box, it will allow functions to be 
called when a variable changes, increments, or 
decrements. Additional events may also be 
easily defined.
