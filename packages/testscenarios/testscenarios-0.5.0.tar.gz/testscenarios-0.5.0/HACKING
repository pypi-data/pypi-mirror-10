Contributing to testscenarios
=============================

Code access
+++++++++++

The main branch is `master` in `https://github.com/testing-cabal/testscenarios`

Publish your branches wherever you like, I encourage github hosting though,
as you can use a pull request there to get a web UI for code review.

Copyright
+++++++++

Testscenarios is Copyright (C) 2009,2015 Robert Collins. I'd like to be able to
offer it up for stdlib inclusion once it has proved itself, so am asking for
copyright assignment to me - or for your contributions to be under either the
BSD and Apache-2.0 licences that Testscenarios are with (which permit inclusion
in Python).

Coding standards
++++++++++++++++

PEP-8 coding style please, though I'm not nitpicky. Make sure that 'make check'
passes before sending in a patch.

Code arrangement
++++++++++++++++

The ``testscenarios`` module should simply import classes and functions from
more specific modules, rather than becoming large and bloated itself. For
instance, TestWithScenarios lives in testscenarios.testcase, and is imported in
the testscenarios __init__.py.

Releases
++++++++

Commit a version to NEWS, tag with a signed tag, make release to build and push
to pypi. push to github.
