Please see the ZBG standard for details on what objects are supported. The short version is you may serialize anything consisting of only:

+ Lists
+ Dictionaries
+ Arbitrary binary

In this particular implementation, to be correctly interpreted, the corresponding python entities should be compatible with:

+ Mutable sequence (see containers.abc.MutableSequence)
+ Mapping (see containers.abc.Mapping)
+ Bytes-like objects (support the buffer protocol)

```dump(obj)```: serializes the entire ```obj```. Object must be as described above. Returns bytes.

```dumpf(obj, f)```: Serializes the ```obj``` to a standalone file. ```f``` is the *open* file handle to output to. ```dumpf``` will not call close(). ```f``` should be opened with mode ```'w+b'```.

```load(zbg)```: Loads a zbg-serialized bytes-like object into memory. Returns an object corresponding to whatever was contained within ```zbg```.

```loadf(f)```: Loads a standalone zbg-serialized file from ```f```. Returns an object corresponding to whatever was contained within ```zbg```. ```f``` should be opened with mode ```'rb'``` and will not be closed by the load.
