Description: elefant
        ---
        
        Allows you to backup and restore your Heroku database
        using your own private storage in S3. This allow circumventing
        the backup limit in Heroku plans and also gives peace of mind 
        that your data is backed up somewhere else besides Heroku.
        
        Tested on Postgres 9.4.
        
        Usage: 
        
        * Ensure AWS credentials are set up in environment variables
        * Ensure heroku is logged in with $ heroku login 
        
        ## Example 
        
        ```python
        from elefant import Elefant
        
        
        # create Elefant object, passing in the Heroku app name
        hb = Elefant("myapp")
        
        print "Making and backup and uploading to S3..."
        hb.backup() 
        
        print "Availiable backups:"
        backups = hb.backups 
        for b in backups: 
        	print b.name
        
        print "Restoring from most recent backup..."
        hb.restore(b) 
        
        print "Restoring from most recent backup using a string..."
        hb.restore(b.name)
        ```
