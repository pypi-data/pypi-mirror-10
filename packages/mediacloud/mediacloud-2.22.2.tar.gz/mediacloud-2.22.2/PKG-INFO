        Examples
        --------
        
        To get all the stories associated with a query and dump the output to
        json:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mediacloud, json
            mc = mediacloud.api.MediaCloud('MY_API_KEY')
            stories = mc.storyList('( hacking AND civic ) OR ( hackathon AND civic)', '+publish_date:[2013-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2014-04-19T00:00:00Z] AND +media_sets_id:1')
            print json.dumps(stories)
        
        Find out how many sentences in the US mainstream media that mentioned
        "Zimbabwe" and "president" in 2013:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mediacloud
            mc = mediacloud.api.MediaCloud('MY_API_KEY')
            res = mc.sentenceCount('( zimbabwe AND president)', '+publish_date:[2013-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2013-12-31T00:00:00Z] AND +media_sets_id:1')
            print res['count'] # prints the number of sentences found
        
        Find the most commonly used words in sentences from the US mainstream
        media that mentioned "Zimbabwe" and "president" in 2013:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mediacloud
            mc = mediacloud.api.MediaCloud('MY_API_KEY')
            words = mc.wordCount('( zimbabwe AND president)', '+publish_date:[2013-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2013-12-31T00:00:00Z] AND +media_sets_id:1')
            print words[0]  #prints the most common word
        
        To find out all the details about one particular story by id:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mediacloud
            mc = mediacloud.api.MediaCloud('MY_API_KEY')
            story = mc.story(169440976)
            print story['url']  # prints the url the story came from
        
        To save the first 100 stories from one day to a database:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mediacloud
            mc = mediacloud.api.MediaCloud('MY_API_KEY')
            db = mediacloud.storage.MongoStoryDatabase('one_day')
            stories = mc.storyList('*', '+publish_date:[2014-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2014-01-01T23:59:59Z]',0,100)
            [db.addStory(s) for story in stories]
            print db.storyCount()
        
        Take a look at the ``apitest.py`` and ``storagetest.py`` for more
        detailed examples.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        First run all the tests. Copy ``mc-client.config.template`` to
        ``mc-client.config`` and edit it. Then run ``python tests.py``.
        
        Notice you get a ``mediacloud-api.log`` that tells you about each query
        it runs.
        
        Distribution
        ------------
        
        To build the distributon, update the version number in
        ``mediacloud/__init__.py``. Then run ``python setup.py sdist`` to test
        out a version. Then when you're ready to push to pypi run
        ``python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi``.
