        A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
        botocore package is the foundation for
        `AWS-CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__.

        **WARNING**
        
        Botocore is currently under a developer preview, and its API is subject
        to change prior to a GA (1.0) release.  Until botocore reaches a 1.0 release,
        backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. The plan for GA is as follows:
        
        1. **DONE** Add client interface to botocore.
        2. **DONE** Add pending deprecation warnings to the use of ``Service`` and ``Operation``
           objects (added in version 0.96.0).
        3. **DONE** Change the pending deprecation warnings to deprecation warnings
           (added in version 0.99.0).
        4. **DONE** Create a
           `clients-only <https://github.com/boto/botocore/tree/clients-only>`_
           branch that completely removes ``Service`` and ``Operation`` objects.
        5. **DONE** Changing the deprecation warnings to ImminentRemovalWarning.  These will
           now print to stderr by default so the warnings are more visible
           (added in version 0.104.0).
        6. **DONE** Merge ``clients-only`` branch to develop branch, and make an alpha
           release of botocore (v 1.0.0a1 released on 5/21/15).
        7. Make a beta release of botocore.
        8. Make GA (1.0.0) release of botocore.
        
        The project is currently at step **7**.
