Description: =====
        Picky
        =====
        
        Picky is a tool for making sure that the packages you have installed
        with `pip`__ or `conda`__ match those you have specified.
        
        It also will let you easily maintain those specifications, even in the
        situation where some packages are installed by pip while others are
        installed using conda.
