        SDAM - (s)tart programs (d)aemonized (a)nd (m)onitored
        ======================================================
        
        With sdam you can start services daemonized and monitored, what means
        that they will be restarted automatically and their output will be put
        in syslog or a logfile. The command given should run in foreground and
        give all output to stdout respective stderr. If sdam.py is not started
        daemonized and no logfile is given, than sdam.py will write the log to
        stderr.
        
        To get more help, try:
        
           $> sdam --help
