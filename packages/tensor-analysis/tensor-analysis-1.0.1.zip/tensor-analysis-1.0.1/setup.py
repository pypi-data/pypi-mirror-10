    Tensor analysis package.\n
    This is a separate version of what_we_commited_to_sympy.\n
    Consists of:\n
    Arraypy class - N-dimentional arrays.\n
    TensorArray class - N-dimentional array with contravariant and covariant indicies.\n
    Classes declared in arraypy.py file.\n
    
    There is also modules:
    1) tensor_methods.py       - Tensor algebra.\n
    2) tensor_fields.py        - operation in tensor fields like diff, rot, lie, etc...\n
    3) riemannian_geometry.py  - tensor operations about some riemannian geometry\n
    4) helper_functions.py     - some help functions.
