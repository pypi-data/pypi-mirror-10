Description: 3D Wallet Generator
        ===================
        
        This project helps you design and export 3D-printable wallets, similar to paper wallets (but they won't die in a flood)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Everyone who's seriously serious about bitcoin has tried paper wallet
        generators. While the idea is great, paper isn't a great medium out of
        which to make something that stores significant value. This this in
        mind, we set out to make a simple, easy-to-use software that can design
        and export 3D-printable wallets, with a variety of configuration
        options.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -  Python3: this project is designed for Python3, not Python2
        -  PyBitcoin, just run ``sudo pip3 install bitcoin``
        -  PyQRCode, just run ``sudo pip3 install pyqrcode``
        -  OpenSCAD 2015 (or higher), just install from their website, and the
           program should find it automatically (submit an issue if it doesn't)
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Supports a variety of configuration and size options
        -  Exports wallets as STL
        -  Export keys as CSV-file for import into other software (for big
           batches)
        -  Set the configuration and let it generate millions of **random**
           wallets for you
        -  Support for other cryptocurrencies, including:
        -  Bitcoin
        -  Litecoin

        Instructions (releases coming soon - not yet available)
        -------------------------------------------------------

        *Mac*
        ~~~~~
        
        1. Download the Mac binary (DMG archive) from the ``Releases`` folder.

        *Linux*
        ~~~~~~~
        
        We recommend you run the linux version off of a LiveUSB for maximum
        security (just as you would with a normal paper wallet) 1. Connect to
        the internet. 2. Run ``sudo apt-get install 3d-wallet-generator`` in a
        Terminal. 3. *Disconnect from the internet!* 4. Run ``gen3dwallet`` in a
        Terminal. 5. Enjoy! Don't connect this device to the internet again
        after you have created your wallet.
