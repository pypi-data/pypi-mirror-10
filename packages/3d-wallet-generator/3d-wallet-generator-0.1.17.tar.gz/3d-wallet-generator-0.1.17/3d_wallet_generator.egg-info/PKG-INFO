Description: 3D Wallet Generator
        ===================
        
        This project helps you design and export 3D-printable wallets, similar to paper wallets (but they won't die in a flood)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Everyone who's seriously serious about bitcoin has tried paper wallet
        generators. While the idea is great, paper isn't a great medium out of
        which to make something that stores significant value. This this in
        mind, we set out to make a simple, easy-to-use software that can design
        and export 3D-printable wallets, with a variety of configuration
        options.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -  Python3: this project is designed for Python3, not Python2
        -  PyBitcoin, ``sudo pip3 install bitcoin`` **(no manual installation required)**
        -  PyQRCode, ``sudo pip3 install pyqrcode`` **(no manual installation required)**
        -  OpenSCAD 2015 (or higher), just install from their website, and the
           program should find it automatically (submit an issue if it doesn't) - **(manual installation required)**
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Supports a variety of configuration and size options
        -  Exports wallets as STL
        -  Export keys as CSV-file for import into other software (for big
           batches)
        -  Set the configuration and let it generate millions of **random**
           wallets for you
        -  Support for other cryptocurrencies, including:
        	- Bitcoin
        	- Litecoin
        	- Dogecoin
        	- Any other currency (as long as you know the version bit for address generation)
        
        Instructions
        ------------
        
        1. Install pip
        	- Windows: download from their website
        	- Mac: install from MacPorts or Brew
        	- Linux: ``sudo apt-get install python3-pip``
        2. Install OpenSCAD
        	- Download from their website (OpenSCad.org/downloads.html)
        	- Make sure you are running their newest version (or at least OpenSCAD 2015)
        	- Contact us if you need help.  
        2. Install our package
        	- Try: ``pip install 3d-wallet-generator``
        	- If it failes, try: ``pip install 3d-wallet-generator``
        	- If it continues to fail, shoot us an email and we'll try to help.
        3. Use our package
        	- Run ``3dwallet -h`` to see your options
        	- Try the default settings by running `3dwallet` - it will output five wallets, with the default settings, into a folder in your current directory.
        	- Play with the other settings and decide how your printer, CNC, etc. likes the different styles.
        	- Film it or take a picture, and give it to us! We'll add it to our collection!
        
        We recommend you run the Linux version off of a LiveUSB for maximum
        security (just as you would with a normal paper wallet).
