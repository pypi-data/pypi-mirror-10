Changed

- Boto replaced Botocore. Boto is a higher-level AWS API that provides
  better error messages. mkwheelhouse's documented functionality should
  remain unchanged, but if you were relying on error messages, you may
  be impacted. **[BREAKING]**
- Documentation converted to reStructuredText.

Added
