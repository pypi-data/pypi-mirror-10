Description: pytraceroute - A simple traceroute(8) implementation in Python
        ===============================================================
        
        pytraceroute is a simple `traceroute(8)` implementation written in
        Python.
        
        Its purpose is mainly educational, rather than something
        feature-rich as is `traceroute(8)` for example.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.7.x or 3.x
        * docopt
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Clone the Git repository and install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/pytraceroute
           $ cd pytraceroute && python setup.py install
        
        Or via `pip`:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install pytraceroute
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        pytraceroute requires root permissions due to the use
        of raw (`socket.SOCK_RAW`) sockets.
        
        Example usage:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ sudo py-traceroute google.com
