Pylinac provides TG-142 quality assurance (QA) tools to Python programmers as well as non-programmers in the field of 
therapy medical physics. The package comes in two flavors: source-level and `web app <https://assuranceqa.herokuapp.com>`_. The source-level
allows programmers and those familiar with Python to create custom tests with pylinac while the web app is for
those who don't want or don't know how to program.

Below are the tools currently available; tools will be added one at a time as they are developed.

* `Starshot Analysis <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starshot_docs.html>`_ -
    A tool for analyzing film or superimposed EPID images for gantry, collimator, or MLC star (aka spoke) shots. Can determine
    the minimum circle that touches all the radiation spokes (wobble). Based on ideas from `Depuydt et al <http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/57/10/2997>`_
    and `Gonzalez et al <http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.1755491>`_ and evolutionary optimization.
* `VMAT QA <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vmat_docs.html>`_ -
    A module for analyzing EPID images after performing the Varian RapidArc QA tests, specifically the Dose Rate & Gantry Speed
    (DRGS) and MLC Speed (MLCS) tests. Can load the open and MLC field images and calculate segment ratios as per the Varian specs.
* `CT & CBCT QA <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cbct_docs.html>`_ -
    A module to automatically analyze DICOM images of a CatPhan 504. Automatically finds the phantom and corrects positioning in all
    6 degrees of freedom. Analysis is based on test descriptions in the
    `manual <http://www.phantomlab.com/library/pdf/catphan504manual.pdf>`_ and analyzes HU linearity and
    image scaling (CTP404), high-contrast line pairs to determine MTF (CTP528), and HU uniformity (CTP486).
* `Log Analysis <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/log_analyzer.html>`_ -
    This module reads Varian logs, both Dynalogs and Trajectory logs and allows exploration of all axes measured. A single log can
    be analyzed as well as batch processing. Trajectory log versions 2.1 and 3.0 are both covered.
* `Picket Fence MLC Analysis <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/picketfence.html>`_ -
    This module will analyze EPID MLC picket fence images, allowing for both a passed
    tolerance as well as an action tolerance. A semi-transparent overlay allows for quick pass/warn/fail assessment.
* `Flatness/Symmetry Analysis <http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/flatsym.html>`_ -
    Analysis of Flatness & Symmetry of film or EPID images. Multiple equation definitions, in/cross plane.

Contributing
------------

Contributions to pylinac can be many. The most useful things a non-programmer can contribute are images to analyze and bug reports. If
you have VMAT images, starshot images, machine log files, CBCT DICOM files, or anything else you want analyzed, email or share them via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc: jkerns at gmail.com
