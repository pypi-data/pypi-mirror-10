        .. warning::
        
           This project is experimental. At this stage, it just describes concepts.
           Perhaps the concepts are implemented by some existing tools.
        
        A typical migration for a web service could include:
        
        * ask admin for confirmation
        * enable maintenance page
        * stop frontends
        * backup data
        * update configuration
        * provision machines (upgrade software)
        * migrate databases
        * restart frontends
        * run smoketests
        * disable maintenance page.
