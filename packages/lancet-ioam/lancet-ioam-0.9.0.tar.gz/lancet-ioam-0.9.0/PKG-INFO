        Lancet
        ======
        
        **Launch jobs, organize the output, and dissect the results.**
        
        More information about Lancet may be found on `Lancet's website
        <http://ioam.github.io/lancet/>`_. Here you may find a quickstart
        example, user documentation, tutorials as well as more information
        about publications involving Lancet.
        
        To obtain Lancet from GitHub::
        
           git clone git://github.com/ioam/lancet.git
        
        In common with many projects on `IOAM <https://github.com/ioam>`_,
        Lancet uses `param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_, so make sure to
        install it with ``pip install param``.
        
        Introduction
        ____________
        
        Lancet is designed to help you organize the output of your research
        tools, store it, and dissect the data you have collected. The output
        of a single simulation or analysis rarely contains all the data you
        need; Lancet helps you generate data from many runs and analyse it
        using your own Python code.
        
        Parameter spaces often need to be explored for the purpose of
        plotting, tuning, or analysis. Lancet helps you extract the
        information you care about from potentially enormous volumes of data
        generated by such parameter exploration.
        
        Features
        ________
        
        * A simple, useful core with advanced functionality strictly
          optional. Use what you need without learning all components.
        
        * All components use a declarative style, helping to ensure
          reproduciblity.
        
        * Succinctly express the high dimensional parameter spaces, without
          nested loops.
        
        * Easily interface with external tools using ShellCommand or quickly
          build a flexible, reusable interfaces to advanced simulators or
          analysis tools. Currently, the Topographica neural simulator is
          actively supported.
        
        * Seamlessly switch from running jobs locally to launching jobs on a
          compute cluster.
        
        * Keep your output organized together with key metadata for
          reproducibility.
        
        * Quickly load your data and view the parameters from previous runs.
        
        * Integrates well with other popular tools such as IPython Notebook
          and the pandas data analysis library.
        
        * Actively used in scientific research and publication.

        Jean-Luc Stevens: Original coding and design
        
        `Marco Elver <https://github.com/melver/lancet>`_ : Python 3 fork,
        cleaned up many aspects of the design.
        
        James A. Bednar: For supporting the development of a solution that
        works with any tool and not just `Topographica
        <http://www.topographica.org>`_ .
        
        Philipp Rudiger: Testing, feedback and suggestions.
