Berry is the partner component for `mint`_. Berry is a tiny agent, that
constantly updates the local credentials file, so that applications can read their most recent passwords easily.

Installation
============

Python 3.4 is required.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install --upgrade stups-berry

Usage
=====

See the help for configuration options:

    berry -h

In addition, berry takes all the [standard AWS SDK inputs](http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs)
(local credentials file, environment variables and instance profiles).
