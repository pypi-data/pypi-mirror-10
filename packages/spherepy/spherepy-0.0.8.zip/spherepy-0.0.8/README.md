SpherePy
========

SpherePy is a package for working with scalar and vector spherical harmonics.
It provides:

* scalar and vector spherical harmonic decompositions
* objects for algebraically manipulating coefficients
* the ability to plot coefficients and patterns

Better Documentation
--------------------


I'm working on a more complete set of documentation 
[HERE](http://www.direentech.com/docs/spherepy).

	
Install
=======


**Ubuntu:**
Before installing SpherePy you must install build-essential, python-dev, and NumPy

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
```

For NumPy you need to decide if you want to build it yourself with

```
$ sudo pip install numpy
```

or download the package with

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
```

I have been building NumPy using the pip method, but it takes a long time. 

Then you can 

```
$ sudo pip install spherepy
```
    
**Windows:**
Make sure you have Numpy on your machine, then

```
$ pip install spherepy
```
	
Plotting
========

If you would like to use the plotting routines within SpherePy, install matplotlib:

```
$ sudo pip install matplotlib
```
	
Quick Example
=============

```python
import spherepy as sp 
c = sp.random_coefs(4, 4) # generate some random coefficients
sp.pretty_coefs(c)
p = sp.ispht(c, 50, 50) # inverse spherical transform to pattern
sp.plot_sphere_mag(p) # plot the magnitude of the pattern
```
