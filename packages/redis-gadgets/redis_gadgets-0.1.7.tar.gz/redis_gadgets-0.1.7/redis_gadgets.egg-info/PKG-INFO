Description: # redis-gadgets
        
        This is a collection of helper tools built on top of redis.

        # Note On Testing
        
        Most of the code here is a thin wrapper over a few redis calls.  Testing it
        without connecting to redis is pretty useless, as such.  To that end, the tests
        make (default) redis connections to pass into the barious tools.  These tests
        are destructive.  The tests run on db=15 with a default Redis connection and will
        clobber all keys matching ``redis_gadgets.unique_count.BASE_NAMESPACE*``. You may
        want to override the test connection to fit your needs.
        
        Pull requests with a better way to do this are welcome.
        
        
        # Unique tracker
        
        This tool uses redis bit sets to track unique events per day.  The tool maps
        between arbitrary string ids and bit offsets, within a namespace (i.e. a given
        id-namespace pair maps to a unique bit offset).  This allows for a relatively
        compact offset space while still enabling tracking of multiple things, e.g.
        unique users viewing pages and unique pages viewed.  There is a default
        namespace 'global' if you don't need this feature.
        
        Events are tracked on day granularity, so the same id-event pairing will only
        be counted once per day. Counts can then be prodouced for arbitrary date
        ranges, using bitwise logical operators.  These rollups are cached with a redis
        expiration timer.
