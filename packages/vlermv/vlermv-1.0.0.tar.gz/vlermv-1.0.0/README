Vlermv
==================
Vlermv makes it easy to save Python
objects to files with meaningful identifiers.
You should concern yourself primarily with these two elements.

``vlermv.Vlermv``
    Class that helps you use the filesystem like a dictionary.
``vlermv.cache``
    Decorator that helps you use ``vlermv.Vlermv`` for caching the output of a function.

Install from PyPI. ::

    pip install vlermv

Then call it like this. ::

    from vlermv import Vlermv
    like_a_dictionary = Vlermv('a-directory')

Now you can mostly pretend that ``like_a_dictionary`` is a dictionary,
except that it will persist across Python sessions.

Decorate the function with ``@vlermv.cache()`` to cache its results. ::

    @vlermv.cache()
    def is_prime(number):
        for n in range(2, number):
            if number % n == 0:
                return False
        return True
