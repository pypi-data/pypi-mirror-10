        This is a set of tools to help with merging, mostly for use with vim_.
        
        At this stage, it's a very basic and development-stage repository.
        The scripts are accessed with the command ``pydifft``
        
        Included are:
        - A very basic merge tool that takes a conflicted file and generates a .merge_head and .merge_new file.
            - you can leave the files saved and come back to a complicated merge later
            - less complex than the gvimdiff merge tool used with git.
            - works with "onewordify," below
        - A script that matches whitespace between two text files.
            - pandoc can convert between markdown/latex/word, but doing this messes with your whitespace and gvimdiff comparisons.
            - This allows you to use an original file with good whitespace formatting as a "template" that you can match other (e.g. pandoc converted file) onto another
        - A script that searches a notebook for numbered tasks, and sees whether or not they match (this is for organizing a lab notebook, to be described)
