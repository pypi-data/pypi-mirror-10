    # output
    You have commited to 200.0 words of
    writing every day!

# Roadmap
Some of the stuff on top of my mind:

* `habito list` can be better. It doesn't check if tables can be output in
terminal screen appropriately :(
* Show how much data is needed to get me on track to meet goals
* Gamification!

# Contribute
`habito` is alpha at the moment. Please try it out and file any issues at github
issues page. Your patches are welcome!
