        Description
        ------------
        
        eventsim makes discrete event easy to simulate
        
        Currently, it consists of three modules:
        models, randgen and simevent
        
        MODULES
        -------
        
        Models
        ------
        
        contains methods for simplifying and calculating:
        
        * probability,
        * estimated variance,
        * estimated mean,
        * estimated standard deviation,
        * expectation value,
        * discreteEmp
        
        most of its methods takes in two arguments, outcome and cummulative probability and a third optional argument which is how many times an item should be generated or times to be calculated.
        
        Randgen
        -------
        
        contains methods for simplifying and generating a:
        
        * random outcome,
        * a unique outcome
        * times of occurrence of outcome
        * probability of occurrence
        * cummulative probability of occurrence
        
        Simevent
        --------
        
        contains methods for generating and estimating events that happens in a workplace scenario. Simulating events like:
        
        * Interarrival time
        * Service time
        * Arrival time
        * Time when service begins
        * Time when service ends
        * Wait time in queue
        * Time customer spends in system
        * Idle time of server
        
        most of its methods takes in two arguments, outcome and cummulative probability and a third optional argument which is how many times an item should be generated or times to be calculated.

        I was inspired to write this package after my university coursework demanded using python to simulate events. I hope Modelling and Simulation students find it useful
        
        All glory belongs to God for helping me in completing my first module.
