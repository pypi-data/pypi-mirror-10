

SIMEVENT
========

contains methods for calculating and generating a:

Inter-arrival time
Service time
Arrival time
Time service begins
Time service ends
Wait time in queue
Time customer spends in system
Idle time of server

HOW TO USE
-----------

To use the 'simevent' module, you need to install the eventsim package first then import it as below
if using:
	from eventsim.simevent import * or 
	from eventsim.simevent import simulation
	from eventsim.simevent import randomsim

	you can then use simulation or randomsim class to call other methods on your generated list
	randomsim heps to generate a randome event simulation whereas simuation gives you flexibility on your code allowing you to enter which values you want.

	just call function names directly
	e.g. v = simulation (3, 10, 5)
		 w = randomsim (6)

	v.arrive() will return the arrival time of all the list in the first argument(inter-arrival time)

if using:
	import eventsim.simevent
	use it like this:
		eventsim.simevent.simulation(3, 10)
		eventsim.simevent.randomsim(3, 10, 5)

	or still, import eventsim.simevent as gen
	so you can then do 

	v = gen.simulation(3)
	w = gen.randomsim(4, 7)

	v.servbegin() which returns the list of the times when the service begins for each customers
	w.servend() which returns the list of the times when the service ends for each customers

CLASSES
-------

SIMULATION
--------

The "simulation" class takes one ot two arguments.
To use this you need to first of all import the "simulation" class:

IMPORTING THE SIMULATION CLASS
---------------------------

from eventsim.simevent import simulation or 
from eventsim.simevent import *

you then need to create an instance of the simulation class to work upon:

CREATING AN INSTANCE
---------------------

v = simulation([arguments])

SIMULATION CLASS ARGUMENTS
--------------------------

passing only one list argument sets it to the value of the inter-arrival time and the service time is randomly generated between 1 and 10

passing two arguments sets the value of inter-arrival time to the first list argument and the value of service time to the second list argument

options | Examples
------------------

v = simulation(int-arr list) | v = simulation([1, 4, 7, 9])
v = generate(int-arr list, service list) | v = generate([1,4,7,9], [2,3,1,4])


RANDOMSIM CLASS ARGUMENTS
-------------------------

passing (no arguments) generates random numbers between 1 and 10 and populates the inter-arrival and service times random times (between 2 and 20 )

passing only (one integer value argument) generates random numbers between 1 and 10 and populates the inter-arrival and service time while the first argument specifies how many values are to be stored in both lists

passing (two list arguments) stores a randomly generated value between 1 and the first argument into the inter-arrival and service time list while the second argument is how many values the two lists should contain

passing three armuments stores a value between 1 and the first argument in the inter-arrival time list, a value between 1 and the second argument in the service time list and the third argument is how big the two lists should be.

options | Examples
------------------

w = randomsim() | w = randomsim()
w = randomsim(size) | w = randomsim(5)
w = randomsim(both-list-range, size) | w = randomsim(10, 5)
w = randomsim(int-arrival range, service range, size) | w = randomsim(6, 10, 5)

METHODS
--------
After the instance has been generated like the examples above, methods that can be called on it are as follows:

Please note that v is just an instance. Any other name can be used instead and all returned results are lists.
They take no arguments.

intarrival --> Returns the interarrival time of customers in a list
service --> Returns the service time of customers in a list
arrival --> Returns the arrival time of customers in a list
servbegin --> Returns the time when service of customers began
servend --> Returns the time service ended for the customers
queuewait --> Returns the customer's waiting time in the queue
custspend --> Returns the time customer spends in system
idle --> Returns the idle time of server

from manual.manuals
manuals("randgen"), manuals("models") or manuals("simevent") prints out the necessary module manual depending on the specified argument.

the module must be imported as all or this manual should be imported manually

Example1
--------

from eventsim.simevent import *  
a = [0, 3, 1, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 1] 
b = [4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4]

test1 = simulation(a,b)

print("Interarrival time:", test1.intarrival())
print("Service time:", test1.service())
print("Arrival time:", test1.arrival())
print("Time service begins:", test1.servbegin())
print("Time service ends:", test1.servend())
print("Wait time in queue:", test1.queuewait())
print("Time customer spends in system:", test1.custspend())
print("Idle time of server", test1.idle())

Result1
-------

Interarrival time: [0, 3, 1, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 1]

Time service ends: [4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 18, 23, 30, 35, 38, 42]
Wait time in queue: [0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5]
Time customer spends in system: [4, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9]

Example2
--------

from eventsim.simevent import *  

test2 = randomsim(4, 6, 10)

print("Interarrival time:", test2.intarrival())
print("Service time:", test2.service())
print("Arrival time:", test2.arrival())
print("Time service begins:", test2.servbegin())
print("Time service ends:", test2.servend())

print("Time customer spends in system:", test2.custspend())
print("Idle time of server", test2.idle())
