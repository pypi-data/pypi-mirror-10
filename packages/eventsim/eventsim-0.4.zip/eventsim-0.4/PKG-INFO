Description: Description
        -----------
        
        eventsim makes discrete event easy to simulate
        
        Currently, it consists of two modules:
        	models and randgen
        
        Modules
        --------
        models contains methods for calculating:
        probability,
        estimated variance,
        estimated mean,
        estimated standard deviation,
        expectation value,
        discreteEmp
        
        most of its methods takes in two arguments, outcome and cummulative probability and a third optional argument which is how many times an item should be generated or times to be calculated.
        
        randgen contains methods for:
        generating a:
        
        random outcome,
        a unique outcome
        times of occurrence of outcome
        probability of occurrence
        cummulative probability of occurrence
        
        
        another module coming soon aimed at generating a real life event simulation scenario in workplace

        I was inspired to write this package after my university coursework demanded using python to simulate events. I hope Modelling and Simulation students find it useful
        
        All glory belongs to God for helping me in completing my first module.
