Description
-----------

eventsim makes discrete event easy to simulate

Currently, it consists of two modules:
	models and randgen

Modules
--------

models
-------
contains methods for simplifying and calculating:
*probability,
*estimated variance,
*estimated mean,
*estimated standard deviation,
*expectation value,
*discreteEmp

most of its methods takes in two arguments, outcome and cummulative probability and a third optional argument which is how many times an item should be generated or times to be calculated.

randgen 
--------
contains methods for simplifying and generating a:

*random outcome,
*a unique outcome
*times of occurrence of outcome
*probability of occurrence
*cummulative probability of occurrence


another module coming soon aimed at generating a real life event simulation scenario in workplace

Requirements
------------

* Any version of python

I was inspired to write this package after my university coursework demanded using python to simulate events. I hope Modelling and Simulation students find it useful

All glory belongs to God for helping me in completing my first module.
