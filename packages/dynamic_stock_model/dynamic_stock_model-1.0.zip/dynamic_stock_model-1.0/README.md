<b> Below, a quick installation guide and a link to the tutorial are provided:</b><br><br>

<b>a) Installation from the web repository:</b> <br>
This is the easiest way of installing dynamic_stock_model. Github hosts an installation package for dynamic_stock_model, which can be downloaded directly from the command line using pip: <br>

> pip install dynamic_stock_model

<b>b) Installation as package:</b> <br>
Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then open a console, change to the directory ../dynamic_stock_model-master/, and install the package from the command line: <br>
> python setup.py install

This makes the package available to Python. At any other place in a system with the same python installation, dynamic_stock_model is now ready to be imported simply by <br>
> import dynamic_stock_model

This setup also allows us to run the unit test: <br>

> import unittest

> import dynamic_stock_model

> import dynamic_stock_model.tests

> unittest.main(dynamic_stock_model.tests, verbosity=2)

Or, to run a specific test

> unittest.main(dynamic_stock_model.tests.test_known_results, verbosity=2)

<br>
<b>c) Manual installation, by modifying the python path</b><br>
Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then include in your code the following lines <br>
> import sys

> sys.path.append('C:\\MyPythonPackages\\dynamic_stock_model-master\\dynamic_stock_model\\')

> from dynamic_stock_model import DynamicStockModel
