        =====
        
        Python class for efficient handling of dynamic stock models
        
        This project contains a class and a connected unit test for modelling dynamic stocks of materials or products,
        as used in dynamic material flow analysis and industrial ecology.

        <br>
        
        <b> Below, a quick installation guide and a link to the tutorial are provided:</b><br><br>
        
        <b>a) Installation from the web repository:</b> <br>
        This is the easiest way of installing dynamic_stock_model. Github hosts an installation package for dynamic_stock_model, which can be downloaded directly from the command line using pip: <br>
        
        > pip install dynamic_stock_model
        
        <b>b) Installation as package:</b> <br>
        Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then open a console, change to the directory ../dynamic_stock_model-master/, and install the package from the command line: <br>
        > python setup.py install
        
        This makes the package available to Python. At any other place in a system with the same python installation, dynamic_stock_model is now ready to be imported simply by <br>
        > import dynamic_stock_model
        
        This setup also allows us to run the unit test: <br>
        
        > import unittest
        
        > import dynamic_stock_model
        
        > import dynamic_stock_model.tests
        
        > unittest.main(dynamic_stock_model.tests, verbosity=2)
        
        Or, to run a specific test
        
        > unittest.main(dynamic_stock_model.tests.test_known_results, verbosity=2)
        
        <br>
        <b>c) Manual installation, by modifying the python path</b><br>
        Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then include in your code the following lines <br>
        > import sys
        
        > sys.path.append('C:\\MyPythonPackages\\dynamic_stock_model-master\\dynamic_stock_model\\')
        
        > from dynamic_stock_model import DynamicStockModel
