CHANGES
=======

0.2.7
-----

* YAQL package housekeeping
* Fixed compatibility with Ply 3.6
* Make py34 job pass successfully
* Open 0.2.7 development

0.2.6
-----

* Update requirements from global-requirements

0.2.5
-----

* Ply version pinned to <=3.4

0.2.4
-----

* Context data evaluation fixed
* Toxify 0.2 branch
* Fix issue with fixed name for parser tables

0.2.3
-----

* Context data fetching improvements
* Added a "get" function with a dictionary get-by-key semantics. Differs from dictionary attribution ("dict.key") because allows dynamic key generation ("dict.get(part1+part2)")
* Added ability to pre-resolve methods
* CLI is now called as "yaql" command, not "yaql-cli" Incremented version to 0.2.1
* Modified some builtin functions (attribution, filtering) etc to handle objects and dictionary properly: Strings are not treated as collections anymore. Exception is now thrown if an unknown property is attempted to be retrieved for an object. Filtering with non-boolean predicates is no longer possible

0.2
---

* Bumped version to 0.2
* Switch function added
* Temporary workaround to make boolean function weekly-typed again
* Temporary functions removed
* parent functions removed, root function finalized
* Pushed data now properly added to the context of function (not the parent context)
* Generator sequences are now limited
* Boolean functions now require strong typing list(*args) function now properly unwraps generators type conversion functions added
* Context-tree reversing added
* Added support for varargs in context-aware functions
* Attempt to add context-manipulation functions (work in progress yet, most probably parent will be removed and root dramatically modified)
* Get context data ($-char) can now be followed by letters as well as digits
* extensions renamed to cli_functions
* Test-data became closer to real-world
* extensiions.py renamed to cli_functions, some temporary debug functions added Console history supoort added
* Collection-collection attribution now properly flattens properties
* Set output dir for parser_table.py in a platform independent way
* Write parser_table_py to a different location
* Empty input is now properly handled in CLI
* Context default data assignment now assigns $1 as well
* Fix precedence for IN operator
* Merge
* Add 'in' operator to YAQL
* CLI will handle all runtime exceptions
* Added ability to run yaql-cli right after setup
* Added license to setup.py
* Separated grammar and lexical exceptions
* Added cli module
* Added 'examples' package
* Generated grammar added to .gitignore
* Updated README
* Added simple setup.py
* Added gitignore
* Updated license notes
* Used @wrap decorator to copy the arguments of context-aware function
* Update LICENSE.txt
* Add Apache 2.0 license
* Initial commit of YAQL: lexical tokenizer, grammar parser and expression executor of the context-based pluggable functions for basic YAQL operations. Implemented basic set of functions: - loading of data from context - attribute access (including collection iteration) - scoping - collection filtering - comparison operators - arithmetic operators - boolean operators - generation of simple data structures (list, dictionary, tuple)
* Initial commit
