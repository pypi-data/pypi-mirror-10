# openQCD Input-file Editor

An input file editor with a graphical user interface for the [openQCD](http://luscher.web.cern.ch/luscher/openQCD) lattice QCD simulation program. Allows editing of existing input files or creation of new ones.

Includes multiple choice options for parameters whenever possible, and performs basic consistency checks on parameters that are entered as text, to reduce the possibility of typos in the input file.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/lkeegan/openQCD-input-file-editor/wiki) for documentation on how to install and use the program. Requires Python 2.7 and PyQt4.

Still in beta - comments / bug reports very welcome!

Thanks to Isabel Campos and Martin Lüscher for their help and comments. Also to Enol Fernández and Álvaro López García for Python advice.
