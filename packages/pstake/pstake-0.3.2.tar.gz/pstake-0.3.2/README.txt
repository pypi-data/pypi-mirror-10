`Pstake <http://pstake.readthedocs.org/>`__ is a simple tool that turns
`PSTricks <http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/>`_ commands into an image file.
(PSTricks_ can draw `any
<http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=Examples/Gallery/Gallery>`__\ `thing
<http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=Examples/Gallery3D/Gallery3D>`__, but
needs TeX/LaTeX.  The quality of the drawings is unbeatable.)  Pstake uses
command line as the primary interface, but also works as a `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ extension and a `SCons <http://www.scons.org>`__
tool.  It is made as a single-file module.
