Description: ansible-tools
        =============
        
        This is a set of wrappers around the ``ansible``, ``ansible-playbook``
        and ``ansible-vault`` commands which integrate with the system keyring
        to retrieve the vault password.
        
        It should work on both Linux and OS X.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        With Homebrew:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ansible-tools
        
        Otherwise:
        
        ::
        
            pip install --user ansible-tools
        
        Then make sure to add the local bin directory to the ``$PATH``. it is
        different on each platform, please refer to ``pip``'s documentation.
        
        Otherwise, if you're feeling dirty:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install ansible-tools
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Go to the same directory that contains your playbooks and then run:
        
        ::
        
            avault-helper --save
        
        You will be prompted for a vault name (which can be anything) and the
        unlock password. This data is securely stored in your login keyring.
        
        The vault name is stored in the ``ansible.cfg`` file, which will be
        created if missing.
        
        At this point you can use the following commands in place of Ansible's
        ones to have the vault be automatically unlocked at each run:
        
        -  ``aplay``: in place of ``ansible-playbook``
        -  ``arun``: in place of ``ansible``
        -  ``avault``: in place of ``ansible-vault``
