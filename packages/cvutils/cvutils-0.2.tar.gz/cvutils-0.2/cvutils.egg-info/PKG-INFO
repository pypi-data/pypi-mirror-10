Description: cvutils
        =======
        
        This repository contains useful utilities to ease the task of creating
        computer vision and image processing projects. A number of command line
        tool have also been added to make the project useful for general use.
        
        REQUIREMENTS
        ------------
        
        1. ``cv2``
        2. ``os``
        3. ``matplotlib``

        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        1. From source
        
           .. code:: bash
        
               git clone https://github.com/bikz05/cvutils.git
               cd cvutils
               python install setup.py
        
        2. From PyPI
        
           ::
        
               pip install cvutils

        COMMAND LINE TOOLS
        ------------------
        
        Resizing an image
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To resize an image use the command-line tool ``cvutils-resize``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            cvutils -i <path to image> -w <required width> -ht <required height>
        
        -  The resuting image is saved in the same directory as the input image
           with the suffix ``-resized`` added before the extension.
        -  Height (``-ht``) is optional and is automatically calculated if width
           is set to zero.
        
        Interactive Crop
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To crop an image use the command-line tool ``cvutils-crop``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            cvutils-crop -i <path to image> 
        
        -  Multiple regions can also be cropped from the image using the script.
        -  Selected regions can also be undone by pressing the ``d`` key.
        -  To save the selects, press ``s`` key and to discard the selections
           press the ``q`` key.
