Remotely Accessible IPython-Enabled Debugger
============================================

Package Description
-------------------
ripdb is a wrapper around the IPython debugger that enables one to connect to
and control the debugger remotely via a socket handler. It combines
the functionality of `ipdb <https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb>`_ and `rpdb
<https://github.com/tamentis/rpdb>`_ in a single package.

Usage
-----
After installation, include the following in your code: ::

  import ripdb
  ripdb.set_trace()

This will start the debugger on port 4444 by default; to use a different port
instantiate the debugger as follows: ::

  import ripdb
  debugger = ripdb.Rpdb(port=12345)
  debugger.set_trace()

Connect to the debugger using a telnet client.
