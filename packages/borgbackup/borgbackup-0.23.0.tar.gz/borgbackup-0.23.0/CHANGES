Borg Changelog
==============

Version 0.23.0
--------------

Incompatible changes (compared to attic, fork related):

- changed sw name and cli command to "borg", updated docs
- package name (and name in urls) uses "borgbackup" to have less collisions
- changed repo / cache internal magic strings from ATTIC* to BORG*,
  changed cache location to .cache/borg/ - this means that it currently won't
  accept attic repos (see issue #21 about improving that)

Bug fixes:

- avoid defect python-msgpack releases, fixes attic #171, fixes attic #185
- fix traceback when trying to do unsupported passphrase change, fixes attic #189
- datetime does not like the year 10.000, fixes attic #139
- fix "info" all archives stats, fixes attic #183
- fix parsing with missing microseconds, fixes attic #282
- fix misleading hint the fuse ImportError handler gave, fixes attic #237
- check unpacked data from RPC for tuple type and correct length, fixes attic #127
- fix Repository._active_txn state when lock upgrade fails
- give specific path to xattr.is_enabled(), disable symlink setattr call that
  always fails
- fix test setup for 32bit platforms, partial fix for attic #196
- upgraded versioneer, PEP440 compliance, fixes attic #257

New features:

- less memory usage: add global option --no-cache-files
- check --last N (only check the last N archives)
- check: sort archives in reverse time order
- rename repo::oldname newname (rename repository)
- create -v output more informative
- create --progress (backup progress indicator)
- create --timestamp (utc string or reference file/dir)
- create: if "-" is given as path, read binary from stdin
- extract: if --stdout is given, write all extracted binary data to stdout
- extract --sparse (simple sparse file support)
- extra debug information for 'fread failed'
- delete <repo> (deletes whole repo + local cache)
- FUSE: reflect deduplication in allocated blocks
- only allow whitelisted RPC calls in server mode
- normalize source/exclude paths before matching
- use posix_fadvise to not spoil the OS cache, fixes attic #252
- toplevel error handler: show tracebacks for better error analysis
- sigusr1 / sigint handler to print current file infos - attic PR #286
- RPCError: include the exception args we get from remote

Other changes:

- source: misc. cleanups, pep8, style
- docs and faq improvements, fixes, updates
- cleanup crypto.pyx, make it easier to adapt to other AES modes
- do os.fsync like recommended in the python docs
- source: Let chunker optionally work with os-level file descriptor.
- source: Linux: remove duplicate os.fsencode calls
- source: refactor _open_rb code a bit, so it is more consistent / regular
- source: refactor indicator (status) and item processing
- source: use py.test for better testing, flake8 for code style checks
- source: fix tox >=2.0 compatibility (test runner)
- pypi package: add python version classifiers, add FreeBSD to platforms
