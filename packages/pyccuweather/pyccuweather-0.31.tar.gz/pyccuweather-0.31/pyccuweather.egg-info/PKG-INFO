Summary: Pyccuweather is a simple, efficient back-end to the Accuweather API. Presently, it allows you to interface with the API and download forecasts, which it then abstracts into files or passes on to the application of your choice. Pyccuweather was designed for integration in large data stores, and as a result, it supports export in various numpy/scipy/pandas formats as well.
