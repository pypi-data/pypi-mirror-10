Description: pytb
        ====
        
        Utility for inspecting python stack of running process (x64 linux only)
        Usage: sudo pytb [pid] If you want to also see greenlet tracebacks, use
        sudo pytb -g [pid] Supports viewing python 2 and python 3 tracebacks (it
        will try to guess, however you can help it by specifying -2 or -3
        option)
        
        The utility works by reading /proc//mem (this is why sudo is needed).
        Also it uses nm and objdump for finding offsets of inner python
        structures.
