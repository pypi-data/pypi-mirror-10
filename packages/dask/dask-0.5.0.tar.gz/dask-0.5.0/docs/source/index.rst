Dask - A Task Scheduling Specification
======================================

Dask encodes directed acyclic graphs of task-oriented computations
using ordinary Python dicts, tuples, and functions.

Dask schedulers execute these graphs efficiently.

Dask Arrays and Bags help users create complex task graphs through high-level
operations.
