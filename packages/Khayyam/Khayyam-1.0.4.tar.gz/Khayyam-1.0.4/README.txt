Khayyam is a library to use date and time in Persian style (known as Jalali calendar or khayyam alg).

It's designed to replace the python standard "datetime.datetime" class with "khayyam.JalaliDatetime".
The "khayyam.JalaliDatetime" has two additional methods that can be used to convert it to Gregorian calendar and vice-versa:

to_datetime(self)

from_datetime(cls)
