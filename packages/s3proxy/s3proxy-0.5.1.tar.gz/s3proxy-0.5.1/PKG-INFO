Description: 
                Exposes an HTTP endpoint for a given S3 bucket and prefix.
                Supports exposing private S3 keys through an IAM key/secret.
                Transparently serves index.html for URLs ending in / and will
                generate an index when no index.html is found.
        
                Originally meant as a way to serve a private pypi repository
                on an S3 bucket.
