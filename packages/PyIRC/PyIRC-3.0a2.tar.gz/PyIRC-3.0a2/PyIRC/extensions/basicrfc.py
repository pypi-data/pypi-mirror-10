    """ Basic RFC1459 support.

    This is basically just a module that ensures your bot doesn't time out and
    can track its own nick. Nobody is making you use this implementation, but
    it is highly recommended.

    This extension adds ``base.basic_rfc`` as itself as an alias for
    ``get_extension("BasicRFC").``.

    :ivar nick:
        Our present real nickname as reported by the IRC server.

    :ivar prev_nick:
        If we get a NICK event from the server, and it's for us, our last nick
        will be stored here. Useful in case of services collisions that change
        our nick, SANICK/FORCENICK operator abuse, or another extension
        changes our nick.
