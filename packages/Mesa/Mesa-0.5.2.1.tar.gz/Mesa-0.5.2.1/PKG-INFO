Name: Mesa
Version: 0.5.2.1
Summary: 
    Mesa is an agent-based modeling (or ABM) framework in Python. It allows
    users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components
    (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized
    implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and
    analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. It's goal is
    to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.

    Mesa is being developed by a group of modeling practitioners with
    experience in academia, government, and the private sector.
