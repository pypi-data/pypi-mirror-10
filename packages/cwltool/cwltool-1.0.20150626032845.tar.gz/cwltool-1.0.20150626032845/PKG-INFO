Description: ==================================================================
        Common workflow language tool description reference implementation
        ==================================================================
        
        This is the reference implementation of the Common Workflow Language.  It is
        intended to be feature complete and provide comprehensive validation of CWL
        files as well as provide other tools related to working with CWL.
        
        This is written and tested for Python 2.7.
        
        There are two packages.  The "cwltool" package is the primary Python module
        containing the reference implementation.  The "cwl-runner" package is optional
        and provides an additional entry point under the alias "cwl-runner", which is
        the implementation-agnostic name for the default CWL interpreter installed on a
        host.
