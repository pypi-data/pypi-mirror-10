systemd bindings written in pure Python, based on C-bindings API of `python-systemd
<http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/python-systemd/>`_.
The main goal of this library is to be very easy to install in a pyvenv or virtualenv, contrary to python-systemd.

**WARNING ! For now, only systemd.journal has been ported, pull requests are welcome.**
