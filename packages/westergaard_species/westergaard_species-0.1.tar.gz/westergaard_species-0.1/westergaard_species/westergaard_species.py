# ## Input Parsing

# ### File Format
# 
# Score analysis will be described by a YAML file.
# YAML files are human readable and the syntax is easy to learn.
# 
# An example file is (note that this is valid YAML, including the comments):
# 
# <hr/>
# 
# ```yaml
# key: c major
# #  Key signature for the score.
# #  It follows the syntax
# #      <pitch> <mode>
# #  Supported pitch names are all valid LilyPond note names.
# #  Supported mode names are 'major', 'minor' and the
# # standard church modes.
# 
# layout:
# # Settings related to the typesetting of the music.
# # They have sane defaults and you only need to
# # specify them if you have speciall needs
#     line-width: 70 # line width of the score in points
#     staff-size: 16 # staff size
# 
# lines:
# #  A list of simultaneous music lines.
# #  Any number of lines is supported.
# #  This example contains 3 lines,
# # named 'upper' and 'lower'
#     - name: upper # name of the line
#       clef: treble
#       #  Clef for the line.
#       #  'treble', 'bass' and 'tenor' are supported.
#       #  Changing clefs in the middle of the line
#       # is not supported.
#       notes: e'1 c' f' e' g' f' e' d' c'
#       # Sequence of notes for the line.
#       # You will have to specify the rhythm of the notes.
#       # Note that the note names are absolute and not relative
#     - name: lower
#       clef: bass
#       notes: c1 e d g e f g g c
# 
# stages:
# # Stages in which the line is generated.
# # There can be any number of stages.
#     - upper: _|1; _|8; _|9
#       #  List of rules for the upper line,
#       # named and described above.
#       #  There can be any number of rules,
#       # generating any number of notes.
#       #  In this case, _ (underscore) rules
#       # are used. The _ rule is a rule with no
#       # name. As such, no rule name will appear
#       # above the notes generated by this rule.
#       #
#       #  A rule of the form "R1|i" means that
#       # note number i (indexing starts at one)
#       # was generated according to rule R1.
#       #  Rules are separated by ; (colons) 
#       lower: _|1; _|7; _|9 
#       # List of rules for the lower line.
#     
#     - upper: ""
#       #  A line with no rules must be written as "".
#       #  This is needed to make the file a valid YAML
#       # file.
#       lower: B3|2
#     
#     - upper: B1|4
#       lower: B1|5; B1|8
#       # The same rule may appear more than once in the
#       # same line.
#     
#     - upper: B2|3; B3|5
#       lower: B2|3; B4|6
#       # Different rules may appear in the same line more
#       # than once.
#     
#     - upper: B3|2; B4|6,7
#       #  A single rule may generate more than one note.
#       #  A rule of the form "R1|i,j,k" means that notes
#       # number i, j and k were generated according to
#       # rule R1
#       lower: B3|4
# ```
# 
# <hr/>
# 
# While the file may appear exceedingly verbose, note that the structure is very clear and after removing the comments and the *layout* part (which is usually not needed) the file is quite short.
# 
# The next sections deal with parsing this file format into an ``abjad.Score`` that can be typeset and analysed.

# ### Key Signature
# 
# The key signature format is very simple:
# 
# <p style='text-align:center'>``key:`` *tonic* *mode*<p>
# 
# It is simply the name of the *tonic* followed by any amount of whitespace, followed by the name of the *mode*.
# *tonic* can be any
# [pitch](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/writing-pitches#note-names-in-other-languages) 
# accepted by LilyPond when configured for the english language (which is not  (e.g. ``a``, ``cf``, ``es``, etc.)
# and *mode* can be one of ``major``, `` minor`` or one of the
# [church modes](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/diatonic-scale)
# (``ionian``, ``dorian``, ``phrygian``, ``lydian``, ``myxolidian``, ``aeolian``, ``locrian``).
# 
# This format taken by the value of the ``key`` item is described by the following regular expression. Note that the expression does not try to validate the *tonic* or *mode* names. The validations is done by the ``parse_key`` function.

# In[ ]:

key_regexp = r"(\s)*(?P<tonic>(\w)*)(\s)*(?P<mode>(\w)*)"


# The ``parse_key`` function generates an ``abjad.KeySignature`` using the regular expression above.

# In[ ]:

def parse_key(line):
    m = re.match(key_regexp, line)
    tonic = m.group('tonic')
    mode = m.group('mode')
    return KeySignature(tonic, mode)


# ### Clef
# 
# The clef is chosen from the line: "``clef: `` *name*" using the function ``parse_clef``.

# In[ ]:

def parse_clef(clef_name):
    return Clef(name=clef_name)


# ## Rules

# A rule is a pairs containing the rule name and the index (indices) of the note (notes) generated by the rule.
# the general format is:  *rulename*``|``*indices*, where:
# 
# - *rulename* is either the character ``_`` (underscore), for an unnamed rule or an arbitrary string not containing the ``|`` (pipe) character
# 
# - *indices* is a comma separated list of integers. The numbering starts at 1 (one). This is more intuitive to users but will have to be accounted for in the code, given that the numbering in python sequences starts at 0 (zero).
# 
# Some examples of well formed rules:
# 
# - ``A1|1`` - rule **A1** generates note number **1**.
# - ``B4|1,2,3`` - rule **B1** generates notes numbered **1**, **2** and **3**.
# - ``A3|1,3,4`` - rule **A3** generates notes numbered **1**, **3** and **4**. Note that the indices do not have to be contiguous integers.
# - ``_|4`` - unnamed rule generates note number **4**. Note number **4** will appear without any rule attached to it.
# 
# The corresponding regular expression to parse a single rule is:

# In[ ]:

rule_regexp = r"(\s)*(?P<name>.*)(\s)*\|(\s)*(?P<rest>.*)"


# The function ``parse_rule`` parses a single rule.
# Note that the indices of the notes generated by the rule are corrected to be 0-based instead of 1-based.

# In[ ]:

def parse_rule(rule):
    rule_m = re.match(rule_regexp, rule)
    name = rule_m.group('name')
    #  A rule name which is an underscore will be used to
    # represent a note that appears according to a rule we
    # do not name (a rule with an empty name)
    if name == '_':
        name = ""
    # The 'rest' part of the rule is a comma separated
    # list of integers.
    rest = rule_m.group('rest')
    indices = rest.strip().split(',')
    #  No need to strip th indices, because int() recognizes
    # a number surrounded by whitespace
    return {'name': name,
            # tranform indices into a 0-based system:
            'indices': map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, indices)}


# The function ``parse_rules`` parses a list of rules spearated by semicolons (``;``):

# In[ ]:

def parse_rules(line):
    rules = filter(lambda x: x, line.strip().split(';'))
    return map(parse_rule, rules)


# ### Parsing the YAML File
# 
# The yaml library makes parsing YAML files into a python dictionary very easy.
# We call that dictionary *steps* because they explain the steps in which a line can be understood.
# 
# The dictionary is mostly created by the ``yaml.safe_load()`` function.
# Parts of the dictionary are then processed from ``strings`` into more advanced types, namely
# ``KeySignature``,
# ``Clef``,
# ``Note``,
# or dicts representing the rules.

# In[ ]:

def steps_from_yaml(text):
    steps = yaml.safe_load(text)
    steps['key'] = parse_key(steps['key'])

    for i, line in enumerate(steps['lines']):
        #  Parse the notes into a proper Abjad Voice.
        #  This allows us to deal with rhythms, including tuplets and ties,
        # which we need for higher species.
        steps['lines'][i]['voice'] = Voice(line['notes'])
        # The string containing the notes is not needed anymore.
        del steps['lines'][i]['notes']
        
        steps['lines'][i]['clef'] = parse_clef(line['clef'])

    for i, stage in enumerate(steps['stages']):
        for line_name, rules in stage.iteritems():
            steps['stages'][i][line_name] = parse_rules(rules)

# ### Generating a LilyPond file from a YAML file
# 
# By default, lilypond tries to typeset the score into an [A4-sized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series) sheet of paper. This is sometimes too small to make the music fit in a single page. This can't be set from the ``Score``, which makes it neccessary to generate a lilypond file instead of only score.
# 
# This allows us to control a great deal of the layout of the score, including:
# 
# - [paper size](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/predefined-paper-sizes)
# - [line width](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/line-length) of the score, to make it wither narrower or wider than the default.
# - [staff size](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/setting-the-staff-size), possibly in combination with the above
# - does the score have bars?
# - what's the offset of the text with or without bars?
