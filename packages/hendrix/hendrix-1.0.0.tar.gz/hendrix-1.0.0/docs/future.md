# Future

###Contributions
Contributions are more than welcome. Feedback and bug reports especially.

Unfortunately a majority of the codebase is **not** covered by tests.
This means that if you want to make changes to Hendrix you'll need to *click
around* to see if it *works*. We're working hard to change this so
please bare with us until then.

###Yet to come
* Ensure stability of current implementation of web sockets
* Load Balancing
* Twisted logging
* Cache regex logic/config file
* Ansible deployment utility
* Salt deployment utility
* more tests...
