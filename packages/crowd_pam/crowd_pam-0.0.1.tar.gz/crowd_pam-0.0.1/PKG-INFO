Description: crowd_pam.py
        =============
        
        Given an Atlassian Crowd server with either its internal user database 
        or some other backend user management system (e.g. LDAP), this utility 
        makes it possible to establish a single-sign-on environment for Linux 
        systems whereby users can log into Linux systems with the same password
         they use against other Crowd backed systems.
        
        When a user attempts to log into a Linux system running crowd_pam.py,
        the username is verified against Crowd and if the user exists in Crowd, 
        a corresponding local Linux user account will be created.  Then if the 
        user's username and password pass authentication, the user will be 
        allowed to sign into the system.
        
        If the user is a member of groups in Crowd that do not exist on the 
        local Linux machine, crowd_pam.py will create the groups on the local 
        Linux system.  If a user is removed from a group membership on Crowd, 
        he/she will be removed from the user group on the local Linux system.
