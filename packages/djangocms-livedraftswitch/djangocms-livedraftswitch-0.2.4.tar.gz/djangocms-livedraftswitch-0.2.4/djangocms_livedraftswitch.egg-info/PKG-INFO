Description: DjangoCMS Live-Draft Switch
        ===========================
        
        Returns classic DjangoCMS-style live-draft switch to DjangoCMS.
        
        Wait, what?
        -----------
        
        With 3.1 release, DjangoCMS crew decided to replace the fabulous
        live-draft toggle / switch with plain dumb boring buttons.
        
        |The change in 3.1|.
        
        **I DON'T THINK SO!!!11number\_one**
        
        This is a quick'n'dirty response to that change. It's a JavaScript
        (jQuery, what else?!) hack that replaces those new buttons with
        something resembling the old toggle.
        
        |Toggle that this app provides|.
        
        Oh common, that's not really a problem!
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Well, it's not, really. But IMHO it's a step in the wrong direction, be
        it a tiny one. And anyways, I find it simpler to quickly whip up this
        app together then to explain to my clients that nothing has really
        changed.
        
        But it's different then it was
        ------------------------------
        
        It's improooooved :)
        
        The differences are cosmetic. And I like to think this one is a bit
        better, because:
        
        -  User can see what mode they are in, as well as what mode they will be
           switching to. This is not a big deal, but it just might help a new
           user with their first edit ever.
        -  Orange Draft indicator is more visible then the classic gray dot.
        
        Ok, how do I install this thing?
        --------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install djangocms-livedraftswitch
        
        Add before ``cms`` app:
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'djangocms-livedraftswitch',  # before cms app
                'cms',
                ...
            )
        
        If you don't like Pypi, you can dump ``djangocms-livedraftswitch``
        directory somewhere in ``PYTHONPATH``.
        
        Compatibility?
        --------------
        
        Not tested much really...
        
        Works with DjangoCMS 3.1.2 and Django 1.7.9.
        
        Browsers:
        
        -  Google Chrome 64
        -  Firefox 38
        -  Safari 8.0.7 - animation is a bit jerky
        -  IE 10+
        -  IE 9 - no animation
        
        Is that a demo project there?
        -----------------------------
        
        If you clone this repo, you'll get a full demo project. Not much of one,
        though, just a default DjangoCMS setup with this app installed. But this
        repo includes a SQLite database, so you can test it right away. Login
        with ``admin`` and ``admin``.
