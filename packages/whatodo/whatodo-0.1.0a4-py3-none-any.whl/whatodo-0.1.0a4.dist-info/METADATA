Description
===========

In software development and any other area of coding it is a common
occerance to use comments for TODO and FIXME for two examples. It can be
difficult with large files and/or large numbers of files to locate these
comments.

whatodo is created to make locating theses comments easier. This app can
read through any number of files and locate these comments returning the
line number of the contents of the actual comment.

The application is written in pure Python with the help of the pygments
library. With this library we are able to parse through more than 100+
languages, for a more detailed description see `pygments
docs <http://pygments.org/languages/>`__

Usage
=====

| The most common use case would be scanning a whole source directory
  for tags, to achieve this you can do the following:
| ``whatodo src/``

For more info and additional options see ``whatodo -h``

Options
-------

::

    - json
    - keyword
    - files

JSON
~~~~

Changes the output format to json, useful for automating with other
tools.

Keyword
~~~~~~~

The Keywords are the words searched for in the beginning of a comment to
determine if this is a comment to extract.

Defaults to TODO, todo, FIXME

Files
~~~~~

The Files are the files searched through to locate comments with the
above mentioned Keywords.

A list of files or directories to analyze and look for TODO's. At least
1 file must be provided.

Installing

::

    pip install whatodo
