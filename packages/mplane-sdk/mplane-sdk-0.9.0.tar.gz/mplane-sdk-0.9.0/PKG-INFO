Description: 
        This module contains the mPlane Software Development Kit.
        
        The draft protocol specification is available in
        https://github.com/fp7mplane/protocol-ri/blob/master/doc/protocol-spec.md.
        
        The mPlane Protocol provides control and data interchange for passive
        and active network measurement tasks. It is built around a simple
        workflow in which **Capabilities** are published by **Components**,
        which can accept **Specifications** for measurements based on these
        Capabilities, and provide **Results**, either inline or via an indirect
        export mechanism negotiated using the protocol.
        
        Measurement statements are fundamentally based on schemas divided into
        Parameters, representing information required to run a measurement or
        query; and Result Columns, the information produced by the measurement
        or query. Measurement interoperability is provided at the element level;
        that is, measurements containing the same Parameters and Result Columns
        are considered to be of the same type and therefore comparable.
