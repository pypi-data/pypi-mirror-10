Version 0.5.5
-------------

*released Fri, 01 May 2015*

Bugfix release:

* fixes some more memory leaks when handling out-of-memory in get_all()
  function
* improve error reporting when an attribute disappears after we asked
  for its length but before we managed to read it
* fix int/size_t issues found by RedHat/Fedora,
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1127310; the fix is
  different than their fix, but it should accomplish the same thing
* convert all code to only do explicit casts after checking boundaries,
  making the code `-Wconversion`-clean (although that warning is not
  enabled by default)

Version 0.5.4
-------------

*released Thu, 30 Apr 2015*

Fix memory leaks on some of the error-handling paths of the `get()`
function.

Version 0.5.3
-------------

*released Fri, 23 May 2014*

Small optimisations release:

* ari edelkind contributed a speed-up optimisation for handling of files
  without xattrs (which is, in general, the expected case)
* Jonas Borgström contributed a behaviour change to the handling of file
  names: under Python 3 and up, unicode paths are encoded/decoded using
  the 'surogatee' handler, instead of the 'strict' handler; while this
  can hide encoding errors, it mirrors what Python libraries do
  (e.g. see os.fsencode/fsdecode)
* Sean Patrick Santos contributed improvements to the test suite so that
  it can be used even on files systems which have built-in attributes
  (e.g. when using SELinux, or NFSv4); to enable this, define the
  attributes in the TEST_IGNORE_XATTRS environment variable

Version 0.5.2
-------------

*released Thu, 03 Jan 2013*

Bug-fix release. Thanks to Michał Górny, it looked like the library had
problem running under pypy, but actually there was a bug in the
PyArg_ParseTuple use of et# (signed vs. unsigned, and lack of compiler
warnings). This was fixed, and now the test suite passed with many
CPython versions and PyPy (version 1.9).

Version 0.5.1
-------------

*released Wed, 16 May 2012*

Bug-fix release. Thanks to Dave Malcolm and his cpychecker tool, a
number of significant bugs (refcount leaks and potential NULL-pointer
dereferences) have been fixed.

Furthermore, compatibility with Python 3 has been improved; this however
required changing the meaning of the ``namespace`` argument to the
functions: if passed, None is no longer a valid value; pass an empty
string if (due to the structure of your program) you have to pass this
argument but want to specify no namespace.

Also, the project home page has changed from SourceForge to GitHub, and
the documentation has been converted from epydoc-based to sphinx.


Version 0.5
-----------

*released Sun, 27 Dec 2009*

Implemented support for Python 3. This required a significant change to
the C module, hence the new version number.

Version 0.4
-----------

*released Mon, 30 Jun 2008*

API
~~~

The old functions ({get,set,list,remove}xattr) are deprecated and replaced with
a new API that is namespace-aware and hopefully will allow other OSes (e.g.
FreeBSD) to be supported more naturally.

Both the old and the new API are supported in the 0.4 versions, however users
are encouraged to migrate to the new API.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new bulk get function called get_all() has been added that should be somewhat
faster in case of querying files which have many attributes.

License
~~~~~~~

Since LGPLv3 is not compatible with GPLv2 (which unfortunately I didn't realize
before), the license was changed to LGPLv2.1 or later.

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

Unittest coverage was improved.

Version 0.3
-----------

*released Sun, 09 Mar 2008*

* changed licence from GPL to LGPL (3 or later)
* changed listxattr return type from tuple to a list
* developer-related: added unittests

Version 0.2.2
-------------

*released Sun, 01 Jul 2007*

* fixed listing symlink xattrs

Version 0.2.1
-------------

*released Sat, 11 Feb 2006*

* fixed a bug when reading symlink EAs (you weren't able to
  do it, actually)
* fixed a possible memory leak when the actual read of the EA
  failed but the call to get the length of the EA didn't
