Contributing to Pygame Zero
===========================

The Pygame Zero project is hosted on bitbucket:

    https://bitbucket.org/lordmauve/pgzero

While developing Pygame Zero it's generally easier to not have to install it, so it may be run with:

   python3 -m pgzero <name of pgzero script>

For example:

   python3 -m pgzero examples/demo1.py
