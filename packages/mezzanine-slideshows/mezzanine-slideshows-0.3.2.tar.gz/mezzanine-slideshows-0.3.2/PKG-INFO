        ====================
        
        mezzanine-slideshows is for use with the `Mezzanine
        CMS <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`__. It allows the placement of
        Mezzanine Galleries within other Mezzanine Pages as slideshows.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        mezzanine-slideshows requires that the following python apps be
        installed:
        
        -  Python 3.4
        -  Mezzanine 3.1 (and its dependencies)
        -  Django 1.7 +  (this app uses the django migrations framework)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest method is to install directly from pypi using
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`__ by running the command below:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install mezzanine-slideshows
        
        Super Quick Start
        -----------------
        
        These instructions are for instant setup with the Mezzanine demonstration installation and
        allow you to place Mezzanine Galleries *at the end* of other Mezzanine Pages as slideshows.
        If you are using anything other than the standard templates provided with a fresh Mezzanine
        install or wish to place the galleries at any place other than the end of pages please
        follow the Regular Setup instructions below.
        
        1. Create a new Mezzanine project following the `official
           instructions <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/overview.html#installation>`__.
        
        2. Add mezzanine\_slideshows to INSTALLED\_APPS in settings.py
           immediately after your Django apps and before your Mezzanine apps:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = (
                   ...
                   "mezzanine_slideshows",
                   ...
                   )
        
        3. Add the following to TEMPLATE\_CONTEXT\_PROCESSORS in settings.py:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
                   ...
                   "mezzanine_slideshows.context_processors.get_slideshows"
                   )
        
        4. Run ``python manage.py migrate mezzanine_slideshows`` to create the
           mezzanine-slideshows models.
        
        5. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a slideshow instance.
        
        6. Navigate to the page on the site to see your gallery displayed after
           the page text as a slideshow.
        
        
        Regular Setup
        -------------
        
        1. Add mezzanine\_slideshows as an app in your project like this:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = (
                   ...
                   "mezzanine_slideshows"
                   )
        
        2. Add the following template context processor in settings.py:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
                   ...
                   "mezzanine_slideshows.context_processors.get_slideshows"
                   )
        
        3. Run ``python manage.py migrate mezzanine_slideshows`` to create the
           mezzanine-slideshows models.
        
        4. In the header of your base.html file after the other css files add the lines
        
           .. code:: html
        
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "mezzanine/css/magnific-popup.css" %}">
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "mezzanine-slideshows/css/owl.carousel.css" %}">
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "mezzanine-slideshows/css/owl.theme.css" %}">
        
        
        5. At the end of your *base.html* file, just after
        
           .. code:: html
        
                {% include "includes/footer_scripts.html" %}
        
           add the following three lines:
        
           .. code:: html
        
                <script src="{% static "mezzanine-slideshows/js/owl.carousel.js" %}"></script>
                <script src="{% static "mezzanine-slideshows/js/jquery.magnific-popup.js" %}"></script>
        
        
        6. This step is key. Without it no slideshows will appear. Add the following code to any place
           you wish a template to check whether a slideshow should be displayed. If a slideshow is dues
           to show on that page it will be displayed at that place in the template:
        
           .. code:: html
        
                {% include "includes/mezzanine_slideshows.html" %}
