        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install colordiffs
        
        How to run
        ==========
        
        ::
        
            git diff HEAD^ | colordiffs | less -r
        
        
        explanation
        
        1. ``git diff HEAD^`` gets a diff between the current and the previous commit
        2. ``colordiffs`` reads a diff from stdin
        3. ``less -r`` takes the output of colordiffs and uses ``less`` to page it, the ``-r`` is required to interpret the terminal escape codes
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ::
        
            Python 2.x, 3.x
            Pygments
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        Support more kinds of `git diff` output. Right not it supports the most common `---` `+++` diffs, but if the diff is for a new file or deletion of file it breaks.
