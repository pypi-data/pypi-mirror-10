a simple CLI menu

There is a single required argument:
* items - a finite iterable (list, tuple, etc) of items which the user will be prompted to choose from

    from pimento import menu
    result = menu(['red', 'blue', 'green', 'grey'])

Prints:
    Options:
      red
      blue
      green
      grey
    Enter an option to continue: 

There are many optional arguments:

    from pimento import menu
    result = menu(
        ['RED robin', 'Blue Bonnet', 'green GIANT'],
        'Food Sources:',
        'Select one [{}]:',
        default_index=1,
        indexed=True,
        insensitive=True,
        search=True
    )

Prints:
    Food Sources:
        [0] 'RED robin'
        [1] 'Blue Bonnet'
        [2] 'green GIANT'
    Select one [Blue Bonnet]:

Entering any of the following will get you a result of "Blue Bonnet":
* <enter>
* 1
* Bl
* bonnet

There is a standalone CLI tool of the same name ('pimento'), which is a wrapper for 'pimento.menu', and can be used to create simple menus quickly on the command line.

pimento has been tested on python 2.7.9 and 3.4.3 on OSX.
