        **********
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Cropper`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Cropper`: http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.cropper``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``cropper`` from ``js.cropper`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.cropper import cropper
          >>> cropper.need()
