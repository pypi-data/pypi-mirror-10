Description: kotti_backend
        *************
        
        This plugin turns Kotti CMS into a private content administration area.
        Basically ``kotti_backend`` let you achieve the same goals described here (`Kotti CMS intranet`_).
        
        What ``kotti_backend`` does:
        
        1. define and load a new ``private_workflow``. If you are installing kotti_backend on
           an existing Kotti installation you'll need to call ``kotti-reset-workflow yourinifile.ini --purge-existing``
           (be extremely **careful** because all your published contents will be converted to the
           private state)
        
        2. apply the above workflow to ``File`` and ``Image`` (they are workflowless by default)
        
        3. set a default fallback permission to all views
        
        4. override the default populator with a custom ACL (no allow view for everyone)

        Setup
        =====
        
        To enable the extension in your Kotti site, activate the configurator::
        
            kotti.configurators =
                kotti_backend.kotti_configure
        
            kotti.use_workflow = kotti_backend:workflows/private_workflow.zcml
        
        If you are going to install ``kotti_backend`` on an already existing site you'll need to reset the
        workflow: read the docs and backup first. See `Kotti security`_
