ObjectRocket Python Client
==========================
ObjectRocket API bindings for Python.


### Examples
To use the bindings, simply do the following:


```python
import objectrocket
>>>

client = objectrocket.Client('<user_key>', '<pass_key>')
>>>

# To create a new instance.
client.instances.create(name='instance0', size=5, zone='US-West', service_type='mongodb', version='2.4.6')
>>> <objectrocket.instances.Instance at 0x10afeacd0>

# To get one of your instances as an Instance object.
client.instances.get('instance0')
>>> <objectrocket.instances.Instance at 0x1097a8390>

# To get all of your instances in a list.
client.instances.get()
>>> [<objectrocket.instances.Instance at 0x1091f9990>]

# To see an instance's compaction state.
client.instances.compaction('instance0')
>>> {u'data': {u'state': u'compressing', ...}}

# To request compaction for an instance.
client.instances.compaction('instance0', request_compaction=True)
>>> {u'data': {u'state': u'requested', ...}}
```


### Installation
Because we do not have the package up on PyPI yet, build the package manually
as mentioned below in [Development Notes](#development_notes). E.G., `tox -e build`. After you
have the ObjectRocket wheel package, install it like so:

    pip install objectrocket-0.1.0-py27-none-any.whl


### Development Notes
#### Running Tests
Before you push your code, run `tox` from the top level directory. If errors
are reported, fix them. If a PEP8 issue is reported, and you do not believe
that it is accurate, place `# noqa` at the end of the line.

#### Coverage Report
To receive a test coverage report, run `tox -e coverage` from the top level directory.

#### Building the Client
To build the client, invoke `tox -e build` from the top level directory.
Your artifact will appear in the `dist` directory, and will look
something like `objectrocket-<version>-py27-<abi>-<platform>.whl`.

#### Building Documentation
To build the documentation, invoke `tox -e docs` from the top level directory.
The HTML index can then be found at `docs/build/html/index.html`.
