python-gearbox
==============
Python library for design of spur and helical gears transmissions

Install
-------
the project is on *pypi* server for installation use:

    pip install python-gearbox

for manual installation download the last release from:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gearbox

    python setup.py install

make shure you have installed all dependencies "jinja2, numpy and scipy"
