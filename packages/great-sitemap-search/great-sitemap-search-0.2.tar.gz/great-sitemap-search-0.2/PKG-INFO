        =====
        
        Simplesearch provides an easy and really simple way to offer search on your website.
        it installs a Class that you can use to execute queries and a managment command you can use to update the indext pages based on a sitemap.xml
        
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "simplesearch" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'simplesearch',
            )
        
        2. edit settings.py file to include the location of the search index.
        
          INDEX_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'index')
        
        2. run the command ./manage.py update_search_index <the url of the sitemap>
        
        3. access the search backen from your views with:
            from simplesearch import SimpleSiteSearcher
        
            searcher = SimpleSiteSearcher()
            results = searcher.search('a query String')
        
           This will return a list like this:
        
           [
                {
                    title:'some tiele',
                    text:'relevant part of the searched text with <b> on the important terms',
                    url:'the url to the page on your site where the text was found'
                },
                ...
           ]
           you may then use the list in your templates to display the search results.
