Version 1.x:
    - More DOCS. 
        Done. Add precision for sites which do have reliable 301. There are two
        types of 301 that I can think of:
            - 301 on folders only. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 404
            - 301 on everything that looks like a folder. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 301
            This is very common on Drupal installations because of some redirect
            plugin.
    - Ensure droopescan runs in kali.
        - Add better error for old requests library?
        - Increase --timeout-host

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format
    - Autospec tests. Especially in update_tests.py as API should be static.
