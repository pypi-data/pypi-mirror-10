Using nbconvert as a library
============================

In this notebook, you will be introduced to the programmatic API of
nbconvert and how it can be used in various contexts.

One of [@jakevdp](https://github.com/jakevdp)'s great `blog
posts <http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/04/15/code-golf-in-python-sudoku/>`__
will be used to demonstrate. This notebook will not focus on using the
command line tool. The attentive reader will point-out that no data is
read from or written to disk during the conversion process. This is
because nbconvert has been designed to work in memory so that it works
well in a database or web-based environement too.

Quick overview
--------------

The main principle of nbconvert is to instantiate an ``Exporter`` that
controls the pipeline through which notebooks are converted.

First, download @jakevdp's notebook (if you do not have ``requests``,
install it by running ``pip install requests``, or if you don't have pip
installed, you can find it on PYPI):

.. code:: python

    import requests
    response = requests.get('http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/notebooks/XKCD_plots.ipynb')
    response.text[0:60] + '...'

The response is a JSON string which represents a Jupyter notebook.

Next, we will read the response using nbformat. Doing this will
guarantee that the notebook structure is valid. Note that the in-memory
format and on disk format are slightly different. In particual, on disk,
multiline strings might be split into a list of strings.

.. code:: python

    import nbformat
    jake_notebook = nbformat.reads(response.text, as_version=4)
    jake_notebook.cells[0]

The nbformat API returns a special type of dictionary. For this examle,
you don't need to worry about the details of the structure (if you are
interested, please see the `nbformat
documentation <http://nbformat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__).

The nbconvert API exposes some basic exporters for common formats and
defaults. You will start by using one of them. First, you will import
one of these exporters (specifically, the HTML exporter), then
instantiate it using most of the defaults, and then you will use it to
process the notebook we downloaded earlier.

.. code:: python

    from traitlets.config import Config
    
    # 1. Import the exporter
    from nbconvert import HTMLExporter
    
    # 2. Instantiate the exporter. We use the `basic` template for now; we'll get into more details
    # later about how to customize the exporter further.
    html_exporter = HTMLExporter()
    html_exporter.template_file = 'basic'
    
    # 3. Process the notebook we loaded earlier
    (body, resources) = html_exporter.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)

The exporter returns a tuple containing the source of the converted
notebook, as well as a resources dict. In this case, the source is just
raw HTML:

.. code:: python

    print(body[:400] + '...')

If you understand HTML, you'll notice that some common tags are ommited,
like the ``body`` tag. Those tags are included in the default
``HtmlExporter``, which is what would have been constructed if we had
not modified the ``template_file``.

The resource dict contains (among many things) the extracted ``.png``,
``.jpg``, etc. from the notebook when applicable. The basic HTML
exporter leaves the figures as embedded base64, but you can configure it
to extract the figures. So for now, the resource dict should be mostly
empty, except for a key containing CSS and a few others whose content
will be obvious:

.. code:: python

    print("Resources:", resources.keys())
    print("Metadata:", resources['metadata'].keys())
    print("Inlining:", resources['inlining'].keys())
    print("Extension:", resources['output_extension'])

``Exporter``\ s are stateless, so you won't be able to extract any
useful information beyond their configuration. You can re-use an
exporter instance to convert another notebook. In addition to the
``from_notebook_node`` used above, each exporter exposes ``from_file``
and ``from_filename`` methods.

Extracting Figures using the RST Exporter
-----------------------------------------

When exporting, you may want to extract the base64 encoded figures as
files. While the HTML exporter does not do this by default, the
``RstExporter`` does:

.. code:: python

    # Import the RST exproter
    from nbconvert import RSTExporter
    # Instantiate it
    rst_exporter = RSTExporter()
    # Convert the notebook to RST format
    (body, resources) = rst_exporter.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)
    
    print(body[:970] + '...')
    print('[.....]')
    print(body[800:1200] + '...')

Notice that base64 images are not embeded, but instead there are
filename-like strings, such as ``output_3_0.png``. The strings actually
are (configurable) keys that map to the binary data in the resources
dict.

Note, if you write an RST Plugin, you are responsible for writing all
the files to the disk (or uploading, etc...) in the right location. Of
course, the naming scheme is configurable.

As an exercise, this notebook will show you how to get one of those
images. First, take a look at the ``'outputs'`` of the returned
resources dictionary. This is a dictionary that contains a key for each
extracted resource, with values corresponding to the actual base64
encoding:

.. code:: python

    sorted(resources['outputs'].keys())

In this case, there are 5 extracted binary figures, all ``png``\ s. We
can use the Image display object to actually display one of the images:

.. code:: python

    from IPython.display import Image
    Image(data=resources['outputs']['output_3_0.png'], format='png')

Note that this image is being rendered without ever reading or writing
to the disk.

Extracting Figures using the HTML Exporter
------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, by default, the HTML exporter does not extract
images -- it just leaves them as inline base64 encodings. However, this
is not always what you might want. For example, here is a use case from
@jakevdp:

    I write an `awesome blog <http://jakevdp.github.io/>`__ using
    Jupyter notebooks converted to HTML, and I want the images to be
    cached. Having one html file with all of the images base64 encoded
    inside it is nice when sharing with a coworker, but for a website,
    not so much. I need an HTML exporter, and I want it to extract the
    figures!

Some theory
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we get into actually extracting the figures, it will be helpful
to give a high-level overview of the process of converting a notebook to
a another format:

1. Retrieve the notebook and it's accompanying resources (you are
   responsible for this).
2. Feed the notebook into the ``Exporter``, which:

   1. Sequentially feeds the notebook into an array of
      ``Preprocessor``\ s. Preprocessors only act on the **structure**
      of the notebook, and have unrestricted access to it.
   2. Feeds the notebook into the Jinja templating engine, which
      converts it to a particular format depending on which template is
      selected.

3. The exporter returns the converted notebook and other relevant
   resources as a tuple.
4. You write the data to the disk using the built-in ``FilesWriter``
   (which writes the notebook and any extracted files to disk), or
   elsewhere using a custom ``Writer``.

Using different preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To extract the figures when using the HTML exporter, we will want to
change which ``Preprocessor``\ s we are using. There are several
preprocessors that come with nbconvert, including one called the
``ExtractOutputPreprocessor``.

The ``ExtractOutputPreprocessor`` is responsible for crawling the
notebook, finding all of the figures, and putting them into the
resources directory, as well as choosing the key (i.e.
``filename_xx_y.extension``) that can replace the figure inside the
template. To enable the ``ExtractOutputPreprocessor``, we must add it to
the exporter's list of preprocessors:

.. code:: python

    # create a configuration object that changes the preprocessors
    from traitlets.config import Config
    c = Config()
    c.HTMLExporter.preprocessors = ['nbconvert.preprocessors.ExtractOutputPreprocessor']
    
    # create the new exporter using the custom config
    html_exporter_with_figs = HTMLExporter(config=c)
    html_exporter_with_figs.preprocessors

We can compare the result of converting the notebook using the original
HTML exporter and our new customized one:

.. code:: python

    (_, resources)          = html_exporter.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)
    (_, resources_with_fig) = html_exporter_with_figs.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)
    
    print("resources without figures:")
    print(sorted(resources.keys()))
    
    print("\nresources with extracted figures (notice that there's one more field called 'outputs'):")
    print(sorted(resources_with_fig.keys()))
    
    print("\nthe actual figures are:")
    print(sorted(resources_with_fig['outputs'].keys()))

Custom Preprocessors
--------------------

There are an endless number of transformations that you may want to
apply to a notebook. In particularly complicated cases, you may want to
actually create your own ``Preprocessor``. Above, when we customized the
list of preprocessors accepted by the ``HTMLExporter``, we passed in a
string -- this can be any valid module name. So, if you create your own
preprocessor, you can include it in that same list and it will be used
by the exporter.

To create your own preprocessor, you will need to subclass from
``nbconvert.preprocessors.Preprocessor`` and overwrite either the
``preprocess`` and/or ``preprocess_cell`` methods.

Example
-------

The following demonstration, as requested in `a GitHub
issue <https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert/pull/137#issuecomment-18658235>`__,
adds the ability to exclude a cell by index.

Note: injecting cells is similar, and won't be covered here. If you want
to inject static content at the beginning/end of a notebook, use a
custom template.

.. code:: python

    from traitlets import Integer
    from nbconvert.preprocessors import Preprocessor
    
    class PelicanSubCell(Preprocessor):
        """A Pelican specific preprocessor to remove some of the cells of a notebook"""
        
        # I could also read the cells from nb.metadata.pelican if someone wrote a JS extension,
        # but for now I'll stay with configurable value. 
        start = Integer(0, config=True, help="first cell of notebook to be converted")
        end   = Integer(-1, config=True, help="last cell of notebook to be converted")
        
        def preprocess(self, nb, resources):
            self.log.info("I'll keep only cells from %d to %d", self.start, self.end)
            nb.cells = nb.cells[self.start:self.end]                    
            return nb, resources

Here a Pelican exporter is created that takes ``PelicanSubCell``
preprocessors and a ``config`` object as parameters. This may seem
redundant, but with the configuration system you can register an
inactive preprocessor on all of the exporters and activate it from
config files or the command line.

.. code:: python

    # Create a new config object that configures both the new preprocessor, as well as the exporter
    c =  Config()
    c.PelicanSubCell.start = 4
    c.PelicanSubCell.end = 6
    c.RSTExporter.preprocessors = [PelicanSubCell]
    
    # Create our new, customized exporter that uses our custom preprocessor
    pelican = RSTExporter(config=c)
    
    # Process the notebook
    print(pelican.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)[0])

Programatically creating templates
----------------------------------

.. code:: python

    from jinja2 import DictLoader
    
    dl = DictLoader({'full.tpl': 
    """
    {%- extends 'basic.tpl' -%} 
    
    {% block footer %}
    FOOOOOOOOTEEEEER
    {% endblock footer %}
    """})
    
    
    exportHTML = HTMLExporter(extra_loaders=[dl])
    (body, resources) = exportHTML.from_notebook_node(jake_notebook)
    for l in body.split('\n')[-4:]:
        print(l)
