    - Existing work which is in Conflict with a Work Registration (EXC)
    - New Work Registration (NWR)
    - Notification of ISWC assign to a work (ISW)
    - Revised Registration (REV)

    While the actual use and intentions of each of these transactions differ, all of them indicate a relationship
    between a Work, Publishers and Writers. Along several details of the work.

    This is a very complex Transaction, composed by more than twenty types of records. Most of them are optional,
    making the possible number of variations huge.

    But all these records can be grouped into four types:
    - Work information record, which is only one, containing the most important information about the record
    - Publishers, divided between those controlled by the submitter and those out of his control
    - Writers, divided between those controlled by the submitter and those out of his control
    - Work details, containing such information as alternate titles or instrument composition

    All, except the first, can appear multiple times in different forms.

    Publishers controlled by the submitter appear along the territories they control, while those out of his
    control appear alone.

    So this section can be described as [[SPU, SPT*]*, OPU*].

    Writers controlled by the submitter appear along their territories and publishers, while those out of his
    control appear alone.

    This section can be described as [[SWR, SWT*, PWR*]*, OWR*].

    The work details are various kinds of data with little relation between them, some of which can appear multiple
    times.

    This section can be described as [ALT*, EWT, VER, PER*, REC, ORN*, INS*, IND*, COM*, ARI*]

    And so, in the end a Work Transaction can be seen as (missing the header record):
    [[SPU, SPT*]*, OPU*, [SWR, SWT*, PWR*]*, OWR*, ALT*, EWT, VER, PER*, REC, ORN*, INS*, IND*, COM*, ARI*]
