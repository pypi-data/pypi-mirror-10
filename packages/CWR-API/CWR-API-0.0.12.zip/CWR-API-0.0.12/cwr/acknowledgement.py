    The acknowledged transactions will be included inside this one.

    these will be returned with a few changes, as the ACK transaction will contain all the records sent by

    control.

    information such as IPI name numbers where possible. In particular, the use of controlled/non-controlled
    record types will be as for the submitter.  For example, if a submitter sent a publisher on an SPU, the ACK will
    contain an SPU for that publisher.

    All the messages caused by processing the records will be included in the ACK transaction along the acknowledged
    transaction.
