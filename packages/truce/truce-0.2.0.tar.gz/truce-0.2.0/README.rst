Truce
=====

An experimental text editor and/or shell (alpha status). Currently, it's
essentially just a minimal text editor with the ability to pipe selected
text through an arbitrary shell command.

Future plans include the ability to use the editor as a filter in pipes,
and the ability to use it to interact with shell-like or REPL-like
programs.
