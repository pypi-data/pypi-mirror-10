Truce
=====

An experimental text editor and/or shell. Alpha status. Currently, it's
essentially just a minimal text editor. Future plans include the ability
to use it as a filter in pipes and the ability to use it to interact
with CLI programs like REPLs, FTP clients, and the like. The goal is to
integrate well with the environment and to blur the distinction between
editor and shell.
