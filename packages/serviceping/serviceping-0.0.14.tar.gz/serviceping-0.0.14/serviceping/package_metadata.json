If a URL is specified it will also\nperform an http get request and show the response.\n\nThis is useful to see when there are hosts doing unexpected things in a dns\nrotation or behind a reverse proxy or vip.\n\nIn this example we specify a url of http://cnn.com/\n\nThis shows that there are two hosts responding to this request and that they\nare returning different amounts of data in their responses.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    $ serviceping http://cnn.com/\n    SERVICEPING cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.18:80).\n    1500 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.19:80):response=200 time=87.14 ms\n    1448 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.226.25:80):response=200 time=64.82 ms\n    1500 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.19:80):response=200 time=62.98 ms\n    1500 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.19:80):response=200 time=78.30 ms\n    --- cnn.com ping statistics ---\n    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 4372.0ms\n    rtt min/avg/max/dev = 62.98/73.31/87.14/56.00 ms\n    $\n\n\nPinging a URL with timings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe detailed timing flag adds timings for each step of each request.\n\nThis is useful for determining what is causing latency issues or errors.\n\nHere we are doing the previous example with detailed timings.\n\nIn the results we can see a few new things.\n\nIt is clear that the host with address 157.166.226.25 is taking significantly longer to establish the tcp connection and handle the http get request.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    $ serviceping -d http://cnn.com/\n    SERVICEPING cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.19:80).\n    1386 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.19:80):response=200 dns=0.21ms connect=68.36ms request=130.02ms all=198.73ms\n    1386 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.226.25:80):response=200 dns=0.30ms connect=66.72ms request=101.07ms all=168.20ms\n    1500 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.255.18:80):response=200 dns=0.30ms connect=123.94ms request=203.08ms all=327.43ms\n    1386 bytes from cnn.com:80 (157.166.226.26:80):response=200 dns=0.28ms connect=68.32ms request=87.94ms all=156.69ms\n    --- cnn.com ping statistics ---\n    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 5009.0ms\n    rtt min/avg/max/dev = 156.69/212.76/327.43/138.24 ms\n    $\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCode licensed under the Apache license.
