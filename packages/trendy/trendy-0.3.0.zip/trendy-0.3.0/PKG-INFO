Description: # Introduction
        
        A python library for interacting with the Trend Deep Security Management API.
        
        
        # Usage
        
        The `Connection` class is the main entry point.  It is designed to be used as a context manager to ensure that the
        connection is closed cleanly and consistently.
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        with Connection(wsdl, user, pass) as trend:
            for profile in  trend.security_profiles.all():
                profile.rules = trend.firewall_rules.by_ids(profile.firewallRules.item)
        ```
        
        See the Trend API documention for more details on the objects and methods available.
