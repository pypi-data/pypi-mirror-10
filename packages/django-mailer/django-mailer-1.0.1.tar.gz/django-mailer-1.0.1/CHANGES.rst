* Included migrations - for both South and Django 1.7 native migrations.

  Note:

  * If you use South, you will need at least South 1.0
  * You will need to use '--fake' or '--fake-initial' on existing installations.

  These migrations were supposed to be in 1.0.0 but were omitted due to a
  packaging error.
