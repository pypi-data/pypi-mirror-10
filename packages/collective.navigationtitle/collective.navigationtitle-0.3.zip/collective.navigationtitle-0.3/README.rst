collective.navigationtitle
==========================

This package allows to add a navigation title by registering a behavior for your dexterity content type.
If you then fill out the field in your content object, this title will be used in the navigation tree.

A big thank you to Jonas Bauman and Jens Klein for all the insights!



Not Entirely Unlike
===================

 `visualtitle <https://github.com/miohtama/visualtitle>`_ which does a similar job for archetypes


Installation
============

Just depend in your buildout on the egg ``collective.navigationtitle``. ZCML is
loaded automagically with z3c.autoinclude.
