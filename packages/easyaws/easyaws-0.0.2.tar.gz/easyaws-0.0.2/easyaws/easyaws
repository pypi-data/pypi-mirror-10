ABOUT EASYAWS:
  Scripts in easyaws package allow easy access to EC2 and S3 (intended to be used by developers). The goal is to create easy-to-use interfaces, analogous to 'cp', 'ssh', 'scp' (which developers are assumed to be already comfortable with), for EC2 and S3.

SETUP EASYAWS:
  To setup, run 'aws configure' to enter your AWS credentials and config.
    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    Default region name [None]: <YOUR_AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>
    Default output format [None]: text

USING EASYAWS:
  Once you have configured your AWS credentials, you can use following scripts that are installed with 'easyaws' package:
    1. 'ec2list': List your EC2 instances
    2. 'ec2ssh':  SSH into EC2 instances using instance name/tag

COMING SOON:
  We are working on following scripts:
    1. 'ec2scp': Script to easily 'scp' files to/from EC2 instances.
    2. 's3cp':   Script to cp files to/from S3 buckets (i.e. 'cp' for S3)
