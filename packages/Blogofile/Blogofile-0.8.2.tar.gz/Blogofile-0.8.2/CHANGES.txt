Next Release
============

- Add Python 3.3 to list of versions that blogofile_blog is tested under.
  That list is now Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Add ``allow_reuse_address`` to server to stop occasional
  "Address already in use" errors.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/pull/140

- Add a ``trailing_slash`` argument to ``blogofile.util.site_path_helper()``.
  When ``True`` a slash is appended to the path.
  The default is ``False``.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile_blog/issues/5

- Fix a template content encoding issue by letting template libraries
  (i.e. Mako and Jinja2) handle template reading.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/134
  and https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/135

- Remove version pinning from dependency packages that Blogofile installs.

=====

If you've been using the ``plugins`` branch from GitHub but haven't updated
in a while you should take note of the following.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix a typo in the README.
  See  https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/pull/127

- Fix an issue with the template lookup order whereby user's templates
  failed to override plugin site_src template of the same name.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/126

- Fix permalinks in RSS feeds for Apple Mail.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/pull/114

- Fix a class name reference error in the Jinga2 template loader.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/105


Features
--------

- The documentation source files have been moved into the project
  repository.
  They are built and rendered at http://docs.blogofile.com/ thanks to
  the readthedocs.org service.

- The init sub-command syntax and functionality has changed; see
  ``blogofile help init``.

- The configuration system has been refactored.
  The default configuration settings are now in the ``default_config.py``
  module.

- As a result of the refactoring of the initialization function,
  and the configuration system,
  the ``site_init`` directory has been eliminated.

- Improved Unicode handling in slugs.
  See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/124

- The codebase has been unified for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2
  (no 2to3 or 3to2 conversion required).

- The command line completion feature has been removed so as to avoid
  maintaining a bundled version of the ``argparse`` library.
  ``argparse`` is included in the standard library for Python 2.7 and
  3.2+.
  ``setup.py`` will install it from PyPI for Python 2.6.
