PyRAS - Python for River AnalysiS
=================================

Description
-----------

A Python suite for working with river models. 

Goals
-----
Offer an abstraction layer for the definition of river models and tools to call controller
of different hydraulic models.

**Models supported (Partial support soon to be completed):**

* **HEC-RAS**: Wrapper for the COM interface of the HEC-RAS controller. (windows only)


**Coming soon:**

* **HEC-RAS API**: High level parser API of HEC-RAS input files. (Cross platform)

Requirements
------------

This package depends on pywin32 for accessing the HECRASController interface.

Additionally, you need to have a working version of HEC-RAS installed. 
Current support includes version 4.1.0 and 5.0.0.


Installation
------------
PyRAS is currently under development until it reaches a minimum stable version.
