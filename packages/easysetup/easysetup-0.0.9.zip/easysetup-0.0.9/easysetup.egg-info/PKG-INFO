        =========
        
        Helps creating a package distribution setup, that also runs tests and creates HTML and PDF documentation, for Windows users.
        
        Description, features and To do
        -------------------------------
        
        **Description**
        
        *easysetup* helps creating a package distribution setup, that also runs tests and creates HTML and PDF documentation, for Windows users.
        
        When running easysetup without options, everything on the current directory is moved to a _bak directory.
        
        After running easysetup, you can find a build.cmd in the current directory that should be run to build your application (execute build -h to see usage options).
        
        **Features:**
        
        * Easy to use, just run easysetup from your application setup directory (it backups everything in current directory to _bak directory when run without options).
        * Allows creating source, wheel, win (exe or msi), py2exe, egg, dumb (zip on windows, tar/ztar/gztar/zip on GNU Linux in the future) and rpm (on GNU Linux in the future) dists.
        * All setup configuration is in one file (appinfo.py).
        * Runs tests and creates HTML and PDF documentation (if you have them, of course).
        * Can publish to PyPI (including documentation if exists) and PyPI tests.
        
        * Creates index.html with redirection to RTD, to be used if preferred for hosting documentation.
        * Creates templates for Travis, Shippable and tox.
        * Creates a template for development requirements.
        * Creates a template for installation requirements.
        * Creates a template for git VCS exceptions.
        * Creates a template for files to be included in the setup.
        * Creates a template for a README file.
        * Creates a template for wheel setup and Sphinx documentation upload.
        * Can create template files in the doc directory (assumes use of Sphinx and that the sphinx-quickstart command was already executed).
        * Can create an updated reference.rst in the doc directory (assumes previous item with the autodoc extension).
        * Updates usage section in README.rst based on usage.txt, if it exists inside your application directory.
        * Saves answers (DEFAULT_AUTHOR, DEFAULT_EMAIL, DEFAULT_LICENSE, DEFAULT_URL and DEFAULT_VERSION) for future use in other applications.
        
        **To do**
        
        * Add appveyor templates.
        * Auto rebuild doc/reference.rst on each dist build.
        * Auto rebuild requirements.txt on each dist build.
        * Change easysetup from Windows only to universal (move build.cmd functionality to easysetup.py).
        * CXF in Py2 and Py3.
        * Checks and error messages.
        * Compile TODOs from py files into README.

        **Installation**

        **Options**
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ easysetup -h
            usage: easysetup [-option]
        
            optional arguments:
              -d, --doc             creates template files in the doc directory
              -h, --help            show this help message
              -l, --license         show license
              -r, --reference       creates an updated reference.rst in the doc directory
              -V, --version         show version
        
            No arguments creates setup files.
