Description: gamma_index
        ===========
        
        Small Python library for calculation of gamma index.
        
        The module offers two functions:
        
        `gamma_matrix` 
            This function calculates gamma index in each point for two
            n-dimensional distributions (with a same shape). It is not
            very optimized, it's O(*n* x *n*), where *n* is the total
            number of elements of the matrix. It takes minutes to calculate
            the 3-D matrix for 50x50x50 distribution.
        
        `gamma_matrix_pass`
            This function returns a boolean matrix (passed / not passed) 
            with optimized search only on a narrow neighbourhood of
            each point. 
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Prepare an optimized version of `gamma_matrix` based on 
          layers
        * Add tests
