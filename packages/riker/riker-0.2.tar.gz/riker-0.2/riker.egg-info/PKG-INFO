        *You're the captain, and Riker is your "Number One"*
        
        
        Heroku-like application deployments to Amazon Web Services.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
          pip install riker
        
        
        Configure
        ---------
        
        ::
        
          riker config
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Deploy a sample app to AWS with a single command:
        
        ::
        
          # Get Python sample app
          git clone git@github.com:heroku/python-sample.git
          cd python-sample
        
          riker deploy
          riker open
        
        This will launch an EC2 instance running the python-sample app, and open it in
        your default web browser.
        
        The first time this is run in your AWS account, it will take some time, as it
        needs to provision a base AMI which all EC2 instances will be launched from.
        Subsequent deploys to the same app will be very quick, and new application
        deployments will only need to wait for a new EC2 instance to boot.
        
        Since Riker uses Heroku Buildpacks, the app can be written in any language.
        
        
        You can also deploy a static website to S3 with the same command:
        
        ::
        
          # Generate simple website
          mkdir static-website && cd static-website
          echo "Hello, World" > index.html
          touch .s3 # indicates deployment to Amazon S3
          git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
        
          riker deploy
          riker open
        
        
        The ``.s3`` file indicates that this app should be deployed to S3.
        
        Riker also supports a production deploy mode, which ensures zero-downtime for
        the application being deployed, and a configuration which supports auto-scaling.
        Usually, Riker will deploy changes directly to existing instances. However, for
        a production deployment, Riker will deploy changes to new instances, and only
        swap old instances out for new instances when the new instances become healthy,
        and the old instances no longer have active connections.
        
        ::
        
          riker deploy --scale
        
        
        This will deploy the app behind a load-balancer and auto-scaling group.
