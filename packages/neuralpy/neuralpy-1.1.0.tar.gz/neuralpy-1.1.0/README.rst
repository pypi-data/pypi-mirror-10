neuralpy 1.1.0
--------

**neuralpy** is a neural network model written in python based on Michael Nielsen's neural networks and deep learning book.

Within this package is the most intuitive fully-connected multilayer neural network model. Data science shouldn't have a high barrier to entry. **neuralpy** handles the math and overhead while you focus on the data.

Visit the (unfinished) `documentation page
<http://pythonhosted.org/neuralpy/>`_ for detailed explanations or get started with the quick start guide below.

Getting Started (quick start)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following demonstrates how to download and install **neuralpy** and how to create and train a simple neural network.
Run the following command to download and install::

	$ pip install neuralpy

Create a neural network in your project by specifying the number of nodes in each layer. Random weights and biases will automatically be generated::
	
	import neuralpy
	net = neuralpy.Network(2, 3, 1)

The network feeds input vectors as python lists forward and returns the output vector as a list::

	x = [1, 1]
	output = net.feedforward(x)
	print output		# ex: [0.11471727263613461]

Train the neural network by first generating training data in the form of a list of tuples. Each tuple has two components and each component is a list representing the input and output respectively. This training set represents the simple OR function::

	datum_1 = ([1, 1], [1])
	datum_2 = ([1, 0], [1])
	datum_3 = ([0, 1], [1])
	datum_4 = ([0, 0], [0])

	training_data = [datum_1, datum_2, datum_3, datum_4]

Then we must specify the remaining hyperparameters. Let's say we want to limit it to 100 epochs and give it a learning rate of 1::

	epochs = 100
	learning_rate = 1

Then run the *train* method with the parameters. We're telling the network to conform to training data::

	net.train(training_data, epochs, learning_rate)

Now feed forward the input from earlier and the output should be closer to 1.0, which is what we trained the network to do::

	output = net.feedforward(x)
	print output		# ex: [0.9542129706170075]

There is more information about advanced options such as monitoring the cost in the `official documentation
<http://pythonhosted.org/neuralpy/>`_.

Since, this is a multilayer feedforward neural network, it is a universal approximator (Hornik, Stinchcombe and White, 1989). Neural Networks can be used for a wide range of applications from image processing to time series prediction.
