Description: sprockets.clients.cassandra
        ===========================
        Provides base functionality for asynchronously accessing/modifying
        data in a Cassandra cluster from within Tornado.
        
        Althought the underlying library supports several connection options,
        this module currently only allows the hostname to be specified, and 
        that via an environment variable called CASSANDRA_URI as specified
        in the docs.
