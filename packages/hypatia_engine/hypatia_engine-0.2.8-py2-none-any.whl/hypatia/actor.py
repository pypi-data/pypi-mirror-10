"""Implementation of actors.

Actors are the base of any entities which may perform actions.
Examples of actors are enemies, NPCs, the player herself, etc.  This
module implements a basic Actor class to serve as the parent for any
classes representing objects such as those examples.  Any logic which
can be shared by all such objects belongs in the class, for example
the logic for moving around the game world.  This approach makes it
possible to allow, for example, enemies and players to share much of
the same behavior, and this can be useful by making it easier (from a
programming point-of-view) to give monsters the same set of core
abilities and logic as NPCs, etc.

When type-checking is necessary the Actor class provides a useful way
to test for objects which support a bare-minimum of core, shared
actions.  The class is also useful in role-playing games for storing
data that tends to be common between the Player, NPCs, enemies, et
alia, a common example being statistics like hit-points.

    """The base class for any entity which can perform actions.

    For example, both Player and NPC objects can move around the game
    world.  This is the type of action which is shared by all 'actors'
    and therefore best implemented in this class, allowing it to be
    shared by as many entities as possible, e.g. enemies.

    It is typically not useful to directly instantiate Actor objects
    but the implementation does not prevent this.

    the direction the actor is facing.  Is it possible to set this
