"""Implementation of actors.

Actors are the base of any entities which may perform actions. Examples
of actors are enemies, NPCs, the player themselves, etc. This module
implements a basic :class:`Actor` class to serve as the parent for any
classes representing objects such those examples. Any logic which can
be shared by all objects belongs in the class, for example, the logic
for moving around the game world. This approach makes it possible to
allow, for example, enemimes and players to share much of the same
behavior, a nd this can be useful by making it easer (from a
programming point-of-view) to give monsters the same set of core
abilities and logic as NPCs, etc.

When type-checking is necessary the :class:`Actor` class provides a
useful way to test for objects which support a bare-minimum of core,
shared actions.  The class is also useful in role-playing games for
storing data that tends to be common between the Player, NPCs, enemies,
etalia, a common example being statistics like hit-points.
