Description: A class to read temperature from a thermistor.
        
        The voltage read-out must be provided by a separate device-dependent package
        (see __init__ descriptor for details).
        
        The class provides method to retrieve the voltage, resistance or temperature,
        to convert the resistance to temperature (B-equation), and to record
        the temperature as a function of time (sub-classing threading.Thread to make it
        to record in the background).
