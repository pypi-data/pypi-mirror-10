Description: 
            Bdot does big dot products (by making your RAM bigger on the inside). 
            It aims to let you do all the things you wish you could do with numpy, 
            but don't have enough RAM for. You can also use it to save on cloud
            compute costs. It's pretty math.
        
            Bdot is based on Bcolz and includes transparent disk-based storage. It was created 
            to simplify nearest neighbor search and other fancy machine learning rigmarole.
