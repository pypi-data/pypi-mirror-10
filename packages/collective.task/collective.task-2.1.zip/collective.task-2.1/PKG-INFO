        ====================
        
        Tasks management for Plone.
        
        This package provides:
        
        * a new content type called task
        * a task behavior, with the same fields as a task
        * a fielset task behavior, with the same fields as a task
        * a task container behavior, just providing a marker interface
        
        A task has the following fields:
        
        * an assigned group: vocabulary of plone groups (can be redefined). Master field for assigned user
        * an assigned user: vocabulary of plone users. Slave field of selected assigned group.
        * an enquirer: user proposing the task (authenticated user by default)
        * a due date
        
        Assigned group and assigned user are local role fields (dexterity.localrolesfield).
        This last product permits to configure (on a dexterity type) the local roles to give on each workflow state, to the selected principal of each role field on the object.
        
        The default workflow for a task contains the following states:
        
        * created (initial state)
        * to assign
        * to do
        * in progress
        * realized
        * closed
        
        From the created state, you can choose the transition "to do". There are 2 cases:
        
        * if an assigned user is already selected, an auto transition passes to "to do" state
        * if no assigned user is selected, a reviewer must choose one and manually pass to "to do" state
        
        This add-on is tested using Travis CI. The current status of the add-on is :
