Change Log
==========

v0.4.0
------
- mma8452 accelerometer now returns dictionary for xyz instead of tuple.
  This was confusing as it's unexpected for a method to return three values.
  *Explicit is better than implicit.*
- Improved docs -- uploaded to readthedocs.

v0.3.0
------
- Fixed mma8452 accelerometer bug. `get_xyz()` now returns values in Gs no
  matter what the range is set as. That is, set the range to be 8G and the
  `get_xyz()` will return 1 is the accelerometer is only experiencing 1G.
- Changed mma8452 register implementation.
- Added mma8452 SI units method.

v0.2.0
------
- Moved internal hardware drivers to hardware directory.
- Added display and humidity/temperature sensor drivers.
- Added examples for drivers.
- NOT updated HTML docs for new changes. This will be done in the next
  update.

v0.1.1
------
- Changed docs for new install instructions (altered name) and also
  changed default address for accelerometer.

v0.1.0
------
- Inital structure.
