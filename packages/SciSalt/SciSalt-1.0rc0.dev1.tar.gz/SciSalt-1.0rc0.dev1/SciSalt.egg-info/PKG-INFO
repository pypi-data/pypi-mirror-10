Description: SciSalt
        =======
        
        This project has slowly grown from frequently-used code snippets. The
        main objective is to create a collection of interconnected methods
        frequently needed to visualize and analyze data using Numpy, Scipy,
        Matplotlib, and PyQt.
        
        It is broken down into sections, with a large main section where most
        everything is kept. It probably should be organized better, but that
        could break backwards compatibility. Organization will probably happen
        if and/or when the package is officially used by >1 person.
