        ----------------
        
        Paragram is an erlang-style concurrency framework for python. This is also known
        as an `actor-based concurrency model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_,
        as it consists of multiple independent `actors` sending messages to each other.
        
        Paragram started as a fork of `candygram`_
        adding true concurrency using threads and processes, but diverged enough to become its
        own library.
