Paragram is an erlang-style concurrency framework for python. This is also known
as an `actor-based concurrency model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_,
as it consists of multiple independent `actors` sending messages to each other.

Paragram started as a fork of `candygram`_
adding true concurrency using threads and processes, but diverged enough to become its
own library.
