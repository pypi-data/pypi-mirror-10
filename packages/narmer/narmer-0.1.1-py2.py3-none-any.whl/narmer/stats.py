    """Return the Weissman score based on entered statistics

    Arguments:
    r_tar -- the target algorithm's compression ratio
    t_tar -- the target algorithm's compression time
    r_src -- a standard algorithm's compression ratio
    t_src -- a standard algorithm's compression time
    alpha -- a scaling constant (1 by default)

    The score is:
    W = Î± * (r / r_bar) * (log(t_bar) / log(t))

    In practice, the score can be used to rate time-intensive tasks on the
    basis of other metrics, also, e.g. F_1 score.
