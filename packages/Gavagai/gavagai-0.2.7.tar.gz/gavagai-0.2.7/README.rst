Install
-------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gavagai

Api key
-------

Get your own api key for free at `Gavagai Developer Portal <https://developer.gavagai.se>`__.

The api key can be specified when instantiating the client, see examples
below. Alternatively, you can set the GAVAGAI\_APIKEY environment
variable, and just call ``GavagaiClient()``.

API methods
-----------

Gavagai Rest API methods supported by this version:

-  ``/keywords`` - Extract salient concepts from a collection of
   texts.
-  ``/lexicon`` - look up a word in `Gavagai Living Lexicon <http://lexicon.gavagai.se/lookup/en/python>`_.
-  ``/tonality`` - Multidimensional sentiment analysis.
-  ``/topics`` & ``/stories`` - Multi-text summarization: get the
   gist of your text collection without having to read through every
   single sentence.

Use
---

See `Gavagai API documentation <https://developer.gavagai.se/docs>`__
for details about available API resources.


Example: API call on a set of texts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/keywords`` resource extracts salient concepts from a collection
of texts. Order by number of occurrences.

.. code:: python

    from gavagai.client import GavagaiClient
    from pprint import pprint

    texts = [
        'Stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of a trip of California. Could not say enough good things about the hotel Monaco. Amazing staff, amazing rooms and the location is brilliant! First stay at a Kimpton hotel, but definitely not the last!!!',
        'I did a lot of research looking for a hotel suite for our family vacation in San Francisco. The Hotel Monaco was a perfect choice. What friendly and delightful staff. I will miss the Grand Cafe, but I will make sure to come back to see their new offerings.',
        'My partner and I spent four nights here over New Years and loved it. Super staff; lovely, quiet room; excellent location within easy walking to much of Downtown and an overall experience that was perfect.'
    ]

    client = GavagaiClient('use_your_own_api_key')
    result = client.keywords(texts)
    keywords = result.json()

    pprint(keywords)


Example: API call with language specified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/tonality`` resource measures multi-dimensional sentiment, based
on lexical analysis. Default language is English, but for texts in other
languages, the language option should be specified.

.. code:: python

    rom gavagai.client import GavagaiClient
    from pprint import pprint

    texts = [u'Din idiot!', u'Jag Ã¤lskar dig.', u'Hen hatar det.']

    client = GavagaiClient('use_your_own_api_key')
    result = client.tonality(texts, language='sv') # swedish language option
    keywords = result.json()

    pprint(keywords)
