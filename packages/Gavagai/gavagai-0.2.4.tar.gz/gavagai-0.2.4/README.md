# gavagai-python
A Gavagai API helper library.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install gavagai
```

## Api key
Get your own api key for free at [Gavagai Developer Portal](https://developer.gavagai.se).

The api key can be specified when instantiating the client, see examples below. Alternatively, you can set the GAVAGAI_APIKEY environment variable, and just call `GavagaiClient()`.


## API methods
Gavagai Rest API methods supported by this version:

* [Keywords]() - Extract salient concepts from a collection of texts.
* [Lexicon]() - look up a word in [Gavagai Living Lexicon](http://lexicon.gavagai.se/lookup/en/python).
* [Tonality]() - Multidimensional sentiment analysis.
* [Topics]() & [Stories]() - Multi-text summarization: get the gist of your text collection without having to read through every single sentence.

## Use
See [Gavagai API documentation](https://developer.gavagai.se/docs) for details about available API resources.

### Example: API call on a set of texts
The `/keywords` resource extracts salient concepts from a collection of texts. Order by number of occurrences.

```python
from gavagai.client import GavagaiClient
from pprint import pprint

texts = [
    'Stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of a trip of California. Could not say enough good things about the hotel Monaco. Amazing staff, amazing rooms and the location is brilliant! First stay at a Kimpton hotel, but definitely not the last!!!',
    'I did a lot of research looking for a hotel suite for our family vacation in San Francisco. The Hotel Monaco was a perfect choice. What friendly and delightful staff. I will miss the Grand Cafe, but I will make sure to come back to see their new offerings.',
    'My partner and I spent four nights here over New Years and loved it. Super staff; lovely, quiet room; excellent location within easy walking to much of Downtown and an overall experience that was perfect.'
]

client = GavagaiClient('use_your_own_api_key')
result = client.keywords(texts)
keywords = result.json()

pprint(keywords)
```


### Example: API call with language specified

The `/tonality` resource measures multi-dimensional sentiment, based on lexical analysis. Default language is English, but for texts in other languages, the language option should be specified.

```python
rom gavagai.client import GavagaiClient
from pprint import pprint

texts = [u'Din idiot!', u'Jag Ã¤lskar dig.', u'Hen hatar det.']

client = GavagaiClient('use_your_own_api_key')
result = client.tonality(texts, language='sv') # swedish language option
keywords = result.json()

pprint(keywords)
```
