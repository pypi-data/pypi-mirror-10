        Pheno is a genetic programming package for Python which supports the 
        application of evolutionary algorithms to arbitrary phenotype design spaces. 
        Pheno utilizes address/value pairs to linearize phenotypes, making it possible 
        to apply standard genetic operators designed for linear chromosomes towards 
        non-linear domains such as abstract syntax trees or artificial neural network
        topologies. Pheno aims, through linearity of chromosomes, to make most of the 
        theory developed for traditional genetic algorithms (e.g. convergence 
        guarantees) applicable to all domains.
