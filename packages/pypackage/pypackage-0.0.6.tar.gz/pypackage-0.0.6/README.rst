Pypackage is a collection of python packaging applications including:

::

    py-build
    py-develop
    py-install
    py-setup
    py-test

The main goal of Pypackage is to make python packaging easier and
faster.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just write some python, run a command,
and have a distributable package? Well now you can!

Features
--------

-  automatic python modules and packages detection
-  automatic inclusion of non-python package data files, and their
   inclusion in and writing of the MANIFEST.in
-  support for three different testing frameworks (pytest, nose, and
   unittest) for use with ``setup.py test``
-  automatic script detection (any executable file in ./bin or
   ./scripts)
-  curses front-end to python classifiers selection

Example, "Hello World" application:
-----------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    $ mkdir hello_world
    $ cd hello_world
    $ vim hello_world.py   # write your python here... :)
    $ py-build -is

The ``py-build -is`` command will take you through an interactive
py-build session and save the setup.py to disk after creating it, but
will not run it.

You can also use the ``py-setup`` command at any time to print what
Pypackage would use as a setup.py in the current directory's context.

Metadata can be mixed in with site-wide defaults from $HOME/.pypackage
if you want to fill in some common attributes for all your projects.

Pypackage also provides three different test runners to automatically
find and run your tests with ``python setup.py test``, you can use any
of pytest, nose or unittest.

To be clear though: pypackage does not intend on replacing setuptools,
pip, or really anything at all in the python packaging tool-chain, it
only attempts to complement those utilities and make getting started
with python packaging a little easier.

In my utopian perfect dream world, I'd see projects not having a
setup.py under source control, instead only a static metadata file, then
having the inverse relationship being true in the distribution version
of the package.

Example, write Python and send it to PyPI
-----------------------------------------

First, `configure your ~/.pypirc
file <https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc>`__
with a ``[pypi]`` section if you haven't already. Now, assuming you lay
out your project something like:

::

    ./your_project
    ./your_project/README.md
    ./your_project/pypackage.meta
    ./your_project/...
    ./your_project/your_project/__init__.py
    ./your_project/your_project/your_code.py
    ./your_project/your_project/...

With pypackage installed, from ``./your_project`` run the following
commands to send your project to PyPI for the first time:

.. code:: bash

    $ py-build
    $ py-build -s
    $ python setup.py register
    $ twine upload dist/* || pip install twine && twine upload dist/*

Every time after that, to update your package is a two step process:

.. code:: bash

    $ py-build
    $ twine upload dist/*

This will upload a binary wheel and source distribution to PyPI so you
can share your work with the world.

The source distribution will include a ``setup.py`` and will not include
the ``pypackage.meta`` if you use one. In this way, Pypackage does not
create a build dependency on your distribution, but rather only on your
source, or perhaps more specifically, your build chain and/or
development environment. Unless you choose to develop off of the
distributed source version, then carry on doing your thing. Just don't
submit any patches to the ``setup.py`` because it's not a real thing in
the source. As a project maintainer, you may even consider adding
``setup.py`` to the ``.gitignore`` of your pypackaged projects.

Further examples
----------------

If your OS can run a bash script, execute ``demo.sh`` in the top level
of this repo to create a new pypackage venv and some simple example
packages in an ``example`` directory. From there feel free to play
around and experiment with pypackage features and applications.
