Description: Pypackage is a collection of python packaging applications including:
        
            py-build
            py-develop
            py-install
            py-setup
            py-test
        
        The main goal of Pypackage is to make python packaging easier and faster.
        
        Wouldn't it be nice if you could just write some python, run a command, and
        have a distributable package? Well now you can!
        
        # Example, "Hello World" application:
        
        ```bash
        $ mkdir hello_world
        $ cd hello_world
        $ vim hello_world.py   # write your python here... :)
        $ py-build -is
        ```
        
        The `py-build -is` command will take you through an interactive py-build
        session and save the setup.py to disk after creating it, but will not run it.
        
        You can also use the `py-setup` command at any time to print what Pypackage
        would use as a setup.py in the current directory's context.
        
        Metadata can be mixed in with site-wide defaults from $HOME/.pypackage if you
        want to fill in some common attributes for all your projects.
        
        Pypackage also provides three different test runners to automatically find and
        run your tests with `python setup.py test`, you can use any of pytest, nose or
        unittest.
        
        To be clear though: pypackage does not intend on replacing setuptools, pip, or
        really anything at all in the python packaging tool-chain, it only attempts to
        compliment those utilities and make getting started with python packaging a
        little easier.
        
        In my utopian perfect dream world, I'd see projects not having a setup.py under
        source control, instead only a static metadata file, then having the inverse
        relationship being true in the distribution version of the package.
