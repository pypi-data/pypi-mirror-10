Summary: This Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) plugin will lock a                    login after a predetermined number of incorrect attempts. Once                    locked, the user will be shown a page that tells them to contact                    their administrator to unlock.

Description: PasswordStrength
        ================
        
        This Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) plugin validates
        passwords against regular expression rules. These rules can
        ensure a passwords strength such as minimum lenth and required
        characters.
        This plugin contains a patch to plone to use PAS validation.
        
        Requires
        --------
        
        - PluggableAuthService and its dependencies
        
        - (optional) PlonePAS and its dependencies
        
        - Plone 4.1 or 4.2.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install ``Products.PasswordStength`` by adding it to your buildout: ::
        
           [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                Products.PasswordStength
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout`` ans start the Zope services.
        
        To use with plone, you need to install PasswordStrength using
        ``portal_quickinstaller`` from ZMI.
        
        Then go to the ``acl_users`` into Plone object and click on
        ``password_strength_plugin``, click on the ``Properties`` tab and
        edit the validation rules.
        
        That's it! Test it out.
        
        ----
        
        **Zope2 product**
        
        Place the Product directory 'PasswordStength' in your 'Products/'
        directory. Restart Zope.
        
        In your PAS 'acl_users', select 'PasswordStrength' from the add
        list.  Give it an id and title, and push the add button.
        
        Enable the 'Validation' plugin interfaces in the after-add screen.
        
        Click on the properties tab and edit the validation rules
        
        That's it! Test it out.
        
        **Note:** PasswordStength doesn't currently generate new passwords. This means that
        you will need to change Plones security settings such that users manually enter
        passwords rather than autogenerate them.
        
        
        Implementation
        --------------
        
        A PAS plugin for Validation checks the password against each regular
        expression listed in the properties. Any rules that fail result in
        the associated error messages being returned.
        
        Plone doesn't use PAS to validate passwords so included is a patch to
        Products.CMFPlone.RegistrationTool.RegistrationTool.testPasswordValidity
        which makes plone use PAS validation plugins.
