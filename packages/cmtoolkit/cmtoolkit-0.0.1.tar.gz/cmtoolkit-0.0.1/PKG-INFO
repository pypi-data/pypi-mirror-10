Description: =========
        cmtoolkit
        =========
        
        This software is a Python library for building and manipulating `conformal maps
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map>`_. Conformal maps are a useful
        tool for solving Laplace's equation - which occurs in heat and diffusion
        transport problems.
        
        This package is an unofficial port of the (MATLAB) `Conformal Mapping Toolkit
        (CMToolkit) <https://github.com/tobydriscoll/conformalmapping>`_, written by
        Toby Driscoll.
