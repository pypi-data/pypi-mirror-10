jmb.filter
=============

jmb.filter is a fork of django-filter that is a generic, reusable
application to alleviate writing some of the more mundane bits of view
code. Specifically, it allows users to filter down a queryset based on
a model's fields, displaying the form to let them do this.

The mail goal of jmb.filter is to add an easy interface to the django
admin interface to get :ref:`advanced search <advanced-search>`
