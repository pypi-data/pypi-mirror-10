Installing django-filter
------------------------

To install, simply place the ``jmb.filters`` as a dependancy (i.e. in
your ``install_requires`` of your setup.py) and add it to your
``INSTALLED_APPS``.

If you don't have a ``setup.py`` (and I don't understand why people don't
use it), add ``jmb.filters`` to your ``requirements.txt``.
