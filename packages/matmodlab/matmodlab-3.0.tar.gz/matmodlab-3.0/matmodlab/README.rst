# Building

The material model laboratory (*matmodlab*) is an object oriented model driver.
The majority of the source code is written in Python and requires no
additional building. Many of the material models, however, are written in
Fortran and require a seperate compile step. The compiling step is handled
dynamically at the time of material instantiation.

# System Requirements

*matmodlab* has been built and tested extensively on several versions of linux
and the Apple Mac OSX 10.8 operating systems.

## Required Software

*matmodlab* requires the following software installed for your platform:

- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org) or newer

- [Numpy 1.8](http://www.numpy.org) or newer

- [Scipy 0.13](http://www.scipy.org) or newer

*matmodlab* is developed and tested using both the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io) and [Enthought](http://www.enthought.com) Python distributions.  We recommend using one of the two, instead of building and installing Numpy and Scipy manually.

## Optional Software

  - Fortran compiler

# Installation

  - Make sure that all *matmodlab* prerequisites are installed and working properly.

  - Add `matmodlab/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable

  - (Optional) Build the fortran utilities. While *matmodlab* is written in
    python, many core linear algebra utilities and several built in material
    models have been implemented in fortran. To build them run

	mml build

## Executables

The user interface is provided by the `matmodlab/bin/mml` executable script.  See

    mml help

for a list of the *matmodlab* commands.

## Testing the Installation

To test *matmodlab* after installation, execute

	mml test -k fast

which will run the "fast" tests found in `matmodlab/tests`

To run the full test suite execute

	mml test [-jN]

Please note that running all of the tests takes some time.

# Troubleshooting

If you experience problems when building/installing/testing *matmodlab*, you
can ask help from Tim Fuller <timothy.fuller@utah.edu>
