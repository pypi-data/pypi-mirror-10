        ==================
        
        Multilingual Sites with Kotti_.
        
        Kotti's data model includes a ``language`` attribute on the ``Content`` class,
        from which all content types inherit.  However, this attribute is neither
        exposed by Kotti's UI, nor used in any other way.  ``kotti_multilingual``
        provides a generic approach to build multilingual sites.
        
        Work in Progress
        ================
        
        ``kotti_multilingual`` is still in an early stage of development.  It is
        neither feature complete nor can be considered API stable.  Things will change!
        
        Features
        ========
        
        The package contains a single content type ``LanguageRoot`` which is
        supposed to be the container of all content in a specific language.  All
        content that is created in (or moved into) such a subtree will be automatically
        tagged with the language of the root.  This is done by subscribing to
        Kotti's ``ObjectInsert`` and ``ObjectUpdate`` events.
        
        You can place ``LanguageRoot`` instances wherever you want in your content
        tree, but it is considered best practice to have a tree structure like this::
        
         - /            Document        language neutral
            - /en       LanguageRoot    English
            - /de       LanguageRoot    German
            - /nl       LanguageRoot    Dutch
            - /images   Document        language neutral
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the ``kotti_multilingual`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config.
        If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.  The added entry
        should look like this::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_multilingual.kotti_configure
        
        You can register an optional ``kotti_multilingual.blacklist`` with the list of the
        type names not handled by kotti_multilingual.

        Tests
        =====
        
        The test setup requires additional steps::
        
            $ virtualenv --no-site-packages .
            $ source bin/activate
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ python setup.py develop
            $ python setup.py dev
        
        How to launch tests::
        
            $ py.test
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2a3 (2015-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed 0.2a2 version (still wrong MANIFEST.in)
        
        0.2a2 (2015-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed MANIFEST.in file
        
        0.2a1 (2015-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Maintain translation links between content items, with translation source
          and targets.
        
        - Add a translation dropdown UI for adding a translation of an item.
        
        - Added ``widget.i10n_widget_factory`` deferred widget.
          Turns field into readonly mode if the context is a translation.
        
          This deferred widget is also compatible with add forms, you should bind an ``addform``
          property to ``True`` and the widget will be rendered as usual in edit mode.
          You can do that adding a ``get_bind_data`` method on your add form.
        
        - Added a ``kotti_multilingual.blacklist`` setting with a list of type names
          not translatable
        
        - Changed policy for translate action. Now the translated document is automatically
          filled with the parent translation (enhanced usability since we don't have the screen
          splitted in two parts like LinguaPlone). This is possible thanks to a change in 
          sqla.py since we don't set language independent attributes on translated documents
        
        - Fixed translation of objects with not nullable fields
        
        - Added support for sqlalchemy's association_proxy
        
        - Fixed intermittent problem with get_source (integrity error)
        
        0.1a3 - 2013-05-08
        ------------------
        
        - Rename ``LanguageSection`` to ``LanguageRoot`` to better fit Kotti's
          ``INavigationRoot``.  This implies a change in the DB schema for which no
          automatic schema migration is available; you'll have to rename the table
          ``language_sections`` to ``language_roots`` yourself.
        
        - Add some tests.
        
        0.1a2 - 2013-05-07
        ------------------
        
        - Removed a lot of code that's now replaced by Kotti's ``INavigationRoot`` /
          ``TemplateAPI.navigation_root``.  This greatly simplifies the setup of
          ``kotti_multilingua``.
        
        - Depend on Kotti>=0.9a3dev (needed for the above).
        
        0.1a1 - 2013-05-06
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release.
