        `KeePassX`_ is a cross platform password manager.  However, KeePassX is a desktop
        GUI application.  That's where ``python-keepassx`` comes in.  By using
        ``python-keepassx``, you can access your passwords using a command line
        interface to KeePassX.  You can also use the python library directly in your
        own python applications.
        
        Python-keepassx: **simple**, command line interface to your passwords.

        Aren't there similar projects already?
        --------------------------------------
        
        Yes.  This project is different because it has:
        
        * A simple, straightforward API.
        * Full support for key files.
        * Both a command line interface and a python API.
        * Support for python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 (and higher).
