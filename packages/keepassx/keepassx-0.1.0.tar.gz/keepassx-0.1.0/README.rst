`KeePassX`_ is a cross platform password manager.  However, KeePassX is a desktop
GUI application.  That's where ``python-keepassx`` comes in.  By using
``python-keepassx``, you can access your passwords using a command line
interface to KeePassX.  You can also use the python library directly in your
own python applications.

Python-keepassx: **simple**, command line interface to your passwords.

Aren't there similar projects already?

Yes.  This project is different because it has:

* A simple, straightforward API.
* Full support for key files.
* Both a command line interface and a python API.
* Support for python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 (and higher).
