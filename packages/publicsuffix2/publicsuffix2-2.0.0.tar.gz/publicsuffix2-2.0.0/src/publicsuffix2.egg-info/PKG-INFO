Description: Public Suffix List module for Python
        ====================================
        
        This module allows you to get the public suffix of a domain name using the
        Public Suffix List from http://publicsuffix.org
        
        A public suffix is a domain suffix under which you can register domain
        names. Some examples of public suffixes are .com, .co.uk and pvt.k12.wy.us.
        Accurately knowing the public suffix of a domain is useful when handling
        web browser cookies, highlighting the most important part of a domain name
        in a user interface or sorting URLs by web site.
        
        This Python module includes with a copy of the Public Suffix List so that it is
        usable out of the box. Newer version try to provide reasonably fresh copies of
        this list.
        
        The code is a fork of the publicsuffix package and uses the same module name and
        API.
        
        The code is MIT-licensed and the publicsuffix data list is MPL-2.0-licensed.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install with::
            pip install publicsuffix2
        
        The module exports a single class that parses the Public Suffix List and allows
        queries for individual domain names::
        
            >>> from publicsuffix import PublicSuffixList
            >>> psl = PublicSuffixList()
            >>> psl.get_public_suffix("www.example.com")
            'example.com'
        
        Note that the ``host`` part of an URL can contain strings that are
        not plain DNS domain names (IP addresses, Punycode-encoded names, name in
        combination with a port number or an username, etc.). It is up to the
        caller to ensure only domain names are passed to the get_public_suffix()
        method.
