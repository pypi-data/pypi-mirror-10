ERAlchemy: Simple entity relation (ER) diagrams generation.
===========================================================

It's now integrated with SQLAlchemy.

It's also able to generate the ER digram from an existing database.

Quick Start
===========

::

    from eralchemy import draw_er
    # Draw from SQLAlchemy base
    draw_er(Base, 'erd_from_sqlalchemy.png')

    # Draw from database
    draw_er("sqlite:///relative/path/to/db.db", 'erd_from_sqlite.png')

Install
=======

``ERAlchemy`` requires
`GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php>`__ to generate the
graphs. Install `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php>`__ for
your system.

Thanks to it's modular architecture, it's an extensible tool: it can
also be connected to other ORMs/ODMs/OGMs.

Notes
=====

ERAlchemy was inspired by `erd <https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd>`__.
