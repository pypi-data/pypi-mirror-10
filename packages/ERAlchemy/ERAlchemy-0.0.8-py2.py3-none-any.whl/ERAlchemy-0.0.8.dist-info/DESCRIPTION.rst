ERAlchemy: Simple entity relation (ER) diagrams generation.
===========================================================

It's now integrated with SQLAlchemy.

It's also able to generate the ER digram from an existing database.

Quick Start
===========

Use from python
---------------

.. code:: python

    from eralchemy import draw_er
    # Draw from SQLAlchemy base
    draw_er(Base, 'erd_from_sqlalchemy.png')

    # Draw from database
    draw_er("sqlite:///relative/path/to/db.db", 'erd_from_sqlite.png')

Use from the command line
-------------------------

::

    render_er -i sqlite:///relative/path/to/db.db -o erd_from_sqlite.png

=======

To install ERAlchemy, just do pip install eralchemy ``ERAlchemy``
requires `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php>`__ to generate

Thanks to it's modular architecture, it's an extensible tool: it can
also be connected to other ORMs/ODMs/OGMs.
