========
Overview
========

Stack-In-A-Box is a RESTful API Testing Framework for unit testing applications against the other services

==========
Installing
==========

Installation is simple:

.. code-block:: bash 

   pip install stackinabox

=====
Goals
=====

- Enable Python modules to be unit tested against externals services in particular in an environment entirely controlled by the unittest.
- The service should be started/stopped and configured from the setup/teardown methods of the unittest
- Support both Postive and Negative testing
- Testing should be easy to do:

  - you should not necessarily need to know the ins and outs of each service
  - you should be able to register what you need (f.e authentication, storage) and have it just work
  
- should be useable on systems like Travis (https://travis-ci.org/)
- should be light on requirements

  - we do not want to bloat your testing to fit our needs
  - if we have many requirements they could interfere with your requirements
  
- The code being unit-tested should not be able to tell the difference of whether it is working with Stack-In-A-Box or the real thing

  - there should be nothing special about setting up the test
  - if you don't turn on Stack-In-A-Box then the code should be able to call the real thing
  - caveat: the utility tools (f.e httpretty, requests-mock) will determine the URL for the Stack-In-A-Box Service which will start differently from the URL of the real thing. For example: if the Hello World service was normally run at 'www.helloworld.com/v1', it's Stack-In-A-Box version was registered with Stack-In-A-Box as 'hello/v1', and Stack-In-A-Box was registered using 'localhost', then it's Stack-In-A-Box URL would be 'http://localhost/hello/v1'. The remainder of the URL and any query-string parameters should be the same.

========================
Why not use framework X?
========================

This project initially setup to provide mock-ups of the OpenStack Keystone and Swift APIs. In doing so other frameworks, such as ``mimic`` (https://github.com/rackerlabs/mimic) were considered.
However, they did not meet the goals set out above. This framework was then built and initially provided the Keystone module that is now part of ``OpenStack-In-A-Box`` (https://github.com/BenjamenMeyer/openstackinabox).
This framework now makes it easy to build services that can be integrated with one of many unit testing frameworks, f.e httpretty, to provide a consistent, reliable unit testing framework that essentially merges the API/Integration-level tests into
the more specific unit tests. It does not, however, replace a proper Integration Test as the responses (in terms of time and integration) will likely be different; but it does allow the unit tests to be sufficient to catch the coding errors early on
so that you can focus on the real integration problems with the Integration-level tests.

This framework is specifically targetted at running the unit tests, as part of the unit tests, and fully controlled by the unit tests. Projects such as ``mimic`` (https://github.com/rackerlabs/mimic) provide a good next-layer of testing if mocked integration level testing is desired; otherwise full integration tests could be utilized.

================
What's Provided?
================

Here's what is currently provided:

- An easy to build Service object and end-point registration that is plug-in-play with StackInABox
- A plug-in-play utility set for several testing frameworks so you the developer can choose which fits your needs best
- An example HelloWorld Service to show the basics

Note: The ``OpenStack-In-A-Box`` (https://github.com/BenjamenMeyer/openstackinabox) provides a more advanced example of building a Stack-In-A-Box Service.

=======================
Working with Frameworks
=======================

Stack-In-A-Box does not itself provide a socket interception framework.
Out-of-the-box it supports the following frameworks:

- HTTPretty (https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty)
- Responses (https://github.com/dropbox/responses)
- Requests-Mock(https://git.openstack.org/cgit/stackforge/requests-mock)

You can use any of them, and you must pull them in via your own test requirements.

-----------
Error Codes
-----------

StackInABox has some specific error codes to help with diagnosing issues:

- 597 - StackInABox - Base URL is correct, but service is unknown
- 596 - StackInABox - Handling StackInABoxService generated an exception
- 595 - StackInABoxService - Route Not handled 

Both of these are extremely easy to use as shown in the following examples:

---------
HTTPretty
---------

``httypretty`` works well with class-based tests.

.. code-block:: python

    import unittest

    import httpretty
    import requests

    import stackinabox.util_httpretty
    from stackinabox.stack import StackInABox
    from stackinabox.services.hello import HelloService


    @httpretty.activate
    class TestHttpretty(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            super(TestHttpretty, self).setUp()
	    StackInABox.register_service(HelloService())

        def tearDown(self):
            super(TestHttpretty, self).tearDown()
	    StackInABox.reset_services()

        def test_basic(self):
            stackinabox.util_httpretty.httpretty_registration('localhost')

            res = requests.get('http://localhost/')
            self.assertEqual(res.status_code, 200)
            self.assertEqual(res.text, 'Hello')
            assert False

---------
Responses
---------

``responses`` works well with function-based tests; however, it does require you use the Python ``requests`` library.

.. code-block:: python

    import unittest

    import responses
    import requests

    import stackinabox.responses
    from stackinabox.stack import StackInABox
    from stackinabox.services.hello import HelloService


    @responses.activate
    def test_basic_responses():
	StackInABox.reset_services()
	StackInABox.register_service(HelloService())
        stackinabox.util_responses.responses_registration('localhost')

        res = requests.get('http://localhost/hello/')
        assert res.status_code == 200
        assert res.text == 'Hello'


-------------
Requests Mock
-------------

``requests-mock`` works well with class-based tests, however, it does require that you use the Python ``requests`` API. If you use ``requests-mock`` directly than you also have to configure ``requests.session.Session`` objects and setup your code to use them. However, Stack-In-A-Box makes that unnecessary by providing thread-based session objects that are automatically registered and patching ``requests`` to return them automatically. Thus you can either use a Session object directly or just use the nice calls that ``requests`` provides and your tests will still just work.

.. code-block:: python

	import unittest

	import requests

	import stackinabox.util_requests_mock
	from stackinabox.stack import StackInABox
	from stackinabox.services.hello import HelloService

	class TestRequestsMock(unittest.TestCase):

		def setUp(self):
			super(TestRequestsMock, self).setUp()
			StackInABox.register_service(HelloService())
			self.session = requests.Session()

		def tearDown(self):
			super(TestRequestsMock, self).tearDown()
			StackInABox.reset_services()
			self.session.close()

		def test_basic_requests_mock(self):
		    # Register with existing session object
			stackinabox.util_requests_mock.requests_mock_session_registration(
				'localhost', self.session)

			res = self.session.get('http://localhost/hello/')
			self.assertEqual(res.status_code, 200)
			self.assertEqual(res.text, 'Hello')

		def test_context_requests_mock(self):
			with stackinabox.util_requests_mock.activate():
                # Register without the session object
				stackinabox.util_requests_mock.requests_mock_registration(
					'localhost')

				res = requests.get('http://localhost/hello/')
				self.assertEqual(res.status_code, 200)
				self.assertEqual(res.text, 'Hello')
