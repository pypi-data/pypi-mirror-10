Description: pygtrie
        =======
        
        pygtrie is a Python library implementing a trie data structure.
        
        Trie data structure, also known as radix or prefix tree, is a tree
        associating keys to values where all the descendants of a node have
        a common prefix (associated with that node).
        
        The trie module contains :class:`trie.Trie`, :class:`trie.CharTrie`
        and :class:`trie.StringTrie` classes each implementing a mutable
        mapping interface, i.e. :class:`dict` interface.  As such, in most
        circumstances, :class:`trie.Trie` could be used as a drop-in
        replacement for a :class:`dict`, but the prefix nature of the data
        structure is trie’s real strength.
        
        The module also contains :class:`trie.PrefixSet` class which uses
        a trie to store a set of prefixes such that a key is contained in the
        set if it or its prefix is stored in the set.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - A full mutable mapping implementation.
        
        - Supports iterating over as well as deleting a subtrie.
        
        - Supports prefix checking as well as shortest and longest prefix
          look-up.
        
        - Extensible for any kind of user-defined keys.
        
        - A PrefixSet supports “all keys starting with given prefix” logic.
        
        - Can store any value including None.
