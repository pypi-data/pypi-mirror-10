Monkey patching for Python
====================================

This library provides Ruby style method name resolution for Python
by monkey patching.


        import monkeypatch as mp

        @mp.monkeypatch
        class ExampleClass(object):
            @mp.route('raise_([0-9]+).to_([0-9]+).power')
            def power(self, a,b):
                return int(a) ** int(b)

        a = ExampleClass()
        print a.raise_2.to_15.power()

Note that due to restrictions in Python, some are not valid attribute names.

       today.5.days.ago()

Also, if the route path has a prefix the same as any attribute that exists
in the original class, the behaviour is undefined and you should not rely
on it.

## Getting Started

      pip install mr-monkeypatch

(MR for method-resolution)
