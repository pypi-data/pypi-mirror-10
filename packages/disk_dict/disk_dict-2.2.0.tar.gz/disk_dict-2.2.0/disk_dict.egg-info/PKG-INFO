Description: DiskDict is a hashtable on your hard drive. It allows you to store KAZILLIONS (!) of key/value pairs and interact with them as you would a Python dictionary, all the while never storing more than two key/value pairs in memory simultaneously. The key/value pairs can be anything that's serializable (you specify the serializer and deserializer, with repr and eval as the default). Since we're operating on the disk, big O of all operations are dependent on the host operating system's file access complexities.
        
        >>> from disk_dict import DiskDict
        >>> from numpy import array
        >>> dd = DiskDict('my_disk_dict')
        >>> a = array([[1,2],[3,4]])
        >>> dd[a] = 'I was pointed to by ' + repr(a)
        >>> dd[a]
        'I was pointed to by array([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]])'
        >>> del dd[a]
        >>> dd[a]
        >>>
