Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the account_invoice_ar source release,
enter the directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name account_invoice_ar.
