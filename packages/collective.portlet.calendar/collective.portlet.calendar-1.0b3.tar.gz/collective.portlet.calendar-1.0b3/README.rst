Life, the Universe, and Everything
----------------------------------

This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet.

It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for events 
with given **keywords**, a set of **review states** and constrain its results
to only an area of your site, selecting a root folder.

If filters given by portlet's configuration panel are not enough, you can
select a **collection** instead of a folder, and all given criteria will be
used to filter yours events.

Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most
sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one
calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.

Filtering by review state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard Plone calendar portlet use a global site settings for filter by review
states (``portal_calendar`` ZMI tool, "Configure" settings).

As this new portlet offer the same filter, the global site settings is
*ignored* and the portlet's "Review state" data is used instead (even if
empty).

The only exception are collections, where both global settings and portlet
settings are ignored; you must manually provide a review state criteria in the
collections if you need it.
