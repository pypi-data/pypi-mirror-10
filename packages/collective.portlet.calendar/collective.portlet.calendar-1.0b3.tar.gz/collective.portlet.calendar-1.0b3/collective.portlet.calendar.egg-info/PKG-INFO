        ----------------------------------
        
        This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet.
        
        It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for events 
        with given **keywords**, a set of **review states** and constrain its results
        to only an area of your site, selecting a root folder.
        
        If filters given by portlet's configuration panel are not enough, you can
        select a **collection** instead of a folder, and all given criteria will be
        used to filter yours events.
        
        Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most
        sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one
        calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.
        
        Filtering by review state
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Standard Plone calendar portlet use a global site settings for filter by review
        states (``portal_calendar`` ZMI tool, "Configure" settings).
        
        As this new portlet offer the same filter, the global site settings is
        *ignored* and the portlet's "Review state" data is used instead (even if
        empty).
        
        The only exception are collections, where both global settings and portlet
        settings are ignored; you must manually provide a review state criteria in the
        collections if you need it.
        
        Mostly Harmless

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Change in the review state usage behavior: if no value is specified do not
          use the global site settings (that was a bit unexpected) but do not filter
          by review state at all.
          [keul]
        - Be sure that start/end criteria in collections never use values outside the
          current month
          [keul]

          or end criteria as calendar machinery already do

          [keul]

          results with collections under certain circumstances
          [keul]
