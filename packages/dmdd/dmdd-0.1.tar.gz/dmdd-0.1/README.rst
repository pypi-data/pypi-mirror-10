dmdd
=========

This package enables simple simulation and Bayesian posterior analysis
of recoil-event data from dark-matter direct-detection experiments 
under a wide variety of scattering theories. It includes the following
features:

* Enables calculation of the nuclear-recoil rates for a wide range of non-relativistic and relativistic scattering operators, including non-standard momentum-, velocity-, and spin-dependent rates,
 
* Accounts for the correct nuclear response functions for each scattering operator, as given in Anand et al. (2013).
  
* Takes into account the natural abundances of isotopes for a variety of experimental target elements.
