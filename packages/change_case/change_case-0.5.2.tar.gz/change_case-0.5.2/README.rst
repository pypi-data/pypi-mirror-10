Change Case
===========

What is this for?
=================

As simple as it is, I was surprised that there was no libraries in pypi that purely handled changing of casing from one
style to another. Sure simple .title() is easy. But this library allows you to easily take any casing type and go from
one to the other.

Types supported

* `camelCase`_ (lower camel case)
* `PascalCase`_ (upper camel case)
* `WikiCase`_
* `snake_case`_
* param-case (for url's)

.. _camelCase: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase
.. _PascalCase: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PascalCase
.. _WikiCase: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28capitalization%29
.. _snake_case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case

Python Version Support
======================

I only plan on supporting python 3, as that is what I primarily use. It works on python 3.3+. I have not tested on
older versions.

Usage
=====

Change Case is easy to use. You simply pass a string to get the new value. Example, if you want to convert a
``camelCasedString`` to a ``snake_cased_string``, you would simply run::

    old = "camelCasedString"
    new = ChangeCase.camel_to_snake(old)
    print(new)
    # camel_cased_string

To see what is possibly, simply view the main file. You can run tests by running the file directly. You can also look at
the tests to see the usage and response of each one.

Tests
=====

You can easily run tests one of two ways. You can run the change_case.py file manually with python, and it will run the
test.::

    python3 change_case.py

or you can do this as well::

    In [1]: from change_case import ChangeCase

    In [2]: ChangeCase.run_tests()

Contributing and Bugs
=====================

You can file any issues you find here:

https://github.com/SkiftCreative/python-change-case/issues

It is fairly simple to add new case types. Simply add the methods to ``ChangeCase`` and add the tests to
``ChangeCase.run_tests()``
