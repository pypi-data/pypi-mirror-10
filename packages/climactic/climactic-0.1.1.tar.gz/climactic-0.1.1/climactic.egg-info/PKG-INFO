Description: # ``climactic``
        
        *Testing command-line utilities*
        
        
        ## Install
        
        Most simply:
        
            pip install climactic
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Create a test file, for example, ``test_git_init.yml``:
        
            ---
            # Run `git init` and verify that
            # the expected directory structure
            # and file contents are produced.
            
            # Sets environment vars
            - env:
                CMD: git
            
            # Runs `git init`
            - run: |
                ${CMD} init
            
            # Verifies the dir tree and files
            # were created
            - assert-tree:
              - .git:
                - HEAD
                - objects:
                - refs:
                  - heads:
                  - tags:
            
            # Verifies that the file .git/HEAD
            # was populated with the ref string
            # for the initial master branch
            - assert-file-utf8:
              - .git/HEAD: |
                  refs/heads/master
        
        ``cd`` to a directory containing this file and run:
        
            ~/climactic/examples$ climactic
            .
