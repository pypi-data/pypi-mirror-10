        Flask-Material packages `MaterializeCSS` <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize> into an extension that mostly consists
        of a blueprint named 'material'. It can also create links to serve Materialize
        from a CDN and works with no boilerplate code in your application.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Here is an example::
        
          from flask_material import Material
        
          [...]
        
          Material(app)
        
        This makes some new templates available, containing blank pages that include all
        bootstrap resources, and have predefined blocks where you can put your content.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        This is largely a fork from the excellent work at <https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap>
