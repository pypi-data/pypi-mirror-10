    The TrestleTree contains the knoweldge base of a partiucluar instance of the
    Trestle algorithm and can be used to fit and categorize instances. Trestle
    adds the ability to handle component attributes as well as relations in
    addition to the numerical and nominal attributes of Cobweb and Cobweb/3.

    Attributes are interpreted in the following ways:

    * Component - ``isinstance(instance[attr],dict) == True``
    * Relation - ``isinstance(instance[attr],list) == True``
    * Numeric - ``isinstance(instance[attr],Number) == True``
    * Nominal - everything else, though the assumption is ``isinstance(instance[attr],str) == True``

        The alpha parameter is the parameter used for laplacian smoothing. The
        higher the value, the higher the prior that all attributes/values are
        equally likely. By default a minor smoothing is used: 0.001.

        The scaling parameter determines whether online normalization of
        continuous attributes is used. By default scaling is used. Scaling
        divides the std of each attribute by the std of the attribute in the
        root node. Scaling is useful to balance the weight of different
        numerical attributes, without scaling the magnitude of numerical
        attributes can affect category utility calculation meaning numbers that
        are naturally larger will recieve extra weight in the calculation.
