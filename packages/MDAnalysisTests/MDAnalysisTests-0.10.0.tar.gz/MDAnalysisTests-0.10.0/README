  MDAnalysisTests README
=============================

MDAnalysis is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

.. NOTE:: *This* package only contains the UnitTests and the data
          files that are used in the test suite of the MDAnalysis
          package http://www.mdanalysis.org. They should be
          installed together with MDAnalysis.

	  You can get MDAnalysis from https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis
	  

The test files change less frequently, take up almost 20 GB of space,
and are not needed for daily use of MDAnalysis so they are distributed
separately from the main package.

For installation instruction please have a look at INSTALL and the
instructions online at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/INSTALL

The tests are described at http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/UnitTests
