'''Filters FASTR data and reports statistics

Usage:

    filter_fastr.py [--version] [--verify] [--min_length] [--max_length]
                    <fastr>

    filter_fastr.py reads a fastr file and seperates entries by size: entries
below a certain length, entries above a certain length, and all entries
in-betweem the specified lengths. Each respective category is written as:

    <fastr>.short.fastr
    <fastr>.long.fastr
    <fastr>.ideal.fastr

Additionally, statistical information on each category is written in:

    <fastr>.short.stats.txt
    <fastr>.long.stats.txt
    <fastr>.ideal.stats.txt

        header:
                The header of the FASTR entry containing the cluster

        clusterStart:
                The position of the first base in the cluster. Position
                reported with 0-index.

        clusterEnd:
                The position of the last base in the cluster. Position
                reported with 0-index.

        localCluster:
                The per base read depth data for all bases in the cluster
                given in the FASTR format (non-compressed). Type
                "metameta generate-fastr" with no arguments for more
                information on the FASTR file type.

        A cluster is defined as all consecutive bases containing non-zero read
    depth data flanked by bases containing read depths of zero or the end of
    the entry. Two examples follow:

        200x0-3x10-4x11-7x18-50x15

        The above entry has a single cluster consisting of the read depth data:
            3x10-4x11-7x18-50x15
        This is one cluster because it is flanked by bases of read depth zero
        on one end and the end of the entry on the other.

        150x0-10x3-20x6-250x7-8-9-10x0-50x1-20x2-30x3-12x7-80x0

        The above entry has two clusters:
            10x3-20x6-250x7-8-9
            50x1-20x2-30x3-12x7
        Both clusters are flanked by bases of read depth zero. Thus this
        function reports two reads with the same heading since they are from
        the same FASTR heading.
