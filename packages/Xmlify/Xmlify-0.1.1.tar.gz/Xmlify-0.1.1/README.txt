Xmlify
======
Xmlify is simple and fast Python built-in type XML serialiser. Its purpose is to convert
nested structures that are composed of types like ``dict``, ``list``, ``tuple``, ``str``, 
``int``, etc. It has no dependencies, uses ``xml.etree.cElementTree`` and produces XML 
structure suitable for humans to read.

Use case
========
I use it for structured logging into MySQL. Later, when I need to investigation an incident,
I can further narrow the result set using `MySQL XML functions 
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/xml-functions.html>`_. You can
use it for something else.

Result markup
=============
Because the XML tree is constructed only using ``xml.etree.cElementTree`` the output is
always valid XML. But it is more restrictive to tag names. Output tag names avoid colon 
(XML namespaces) and are ASCII-only, even though the specification `permits Unicode 
codepoints <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameChar>`_. It was to simplify things, 
as there was no benefit of having Unicode tags, and to maximise XML parser compatibility. 

Unicode tag names are hex-encoded and prefixed with ``x``. XML-incompatible binary values
are hex-encoded in the same way. XML-incompatible ASCII characters in tag names are replaced 
with underscore. If tag name starts with a digit it is prefixed with ``n``. Though, it's easy
to override. The following regular expressions control substitution and tag's first character
match. You can also monkeypatch ``xmlify._key`` completely.   

.. sourcecode:: python

  xmlify._notFirstCharRe  = re.compile(r'[^a-z_]{1}', re.IGNORECASE)
  xmlify._notOtherCharsRe = re.compile(r'[^a-z0-9_\-\.]', re.IGNORECASE)

The type information isn't preserved intentionally to make the output easier to read to a human.
If you need to preserve type information or to convert XML to objects two-way, just use stdlib's
``xmlrpclib.dumps``/``xmlrpclib.loads``. 

Usage
=====
This is the public API:

.. sourcecode:: python

  def dump(obj, fp, root = 'data', declaration = False): pass
  
  def dumps(obj, root = 'data', declaration = False): pass
  
Use it like:

.. sourcecode:: python

  import datetime
  import xmlify
  
  d = {
    'python' : {
      2 : {
        2.7 : {
          'version' : (2, 7, 10),
          'date'    : datetime.date(2015, 5, 23) 
        }
      },
      3 : {
        3.3 : {
          'version' : (3, 3, 6),
          'date'    : datetime.date(2014, 10, 12) 
        },
        3.4 : {
          'version' : (3, 4, 3),
          'date'    : datetime.date(2015, 2, 25) 
        }        
      }
    }
  }
  print(xmlify.dumps(d))

It prints the following XML (indented separately):
  
.. sourcecode:: xml

  <data>
    <python>
      <n2>
        <n2.7>
          <date>2015-05-23</date>
          <version>
            <version-item>2</version-item>
            <version-item>7</version-item>
            <version-item>10</version-item>
          </version>
        </n2.7>
      </n2>
      <n3>
        <n3.3>
          <date>2014-10-12</date>
          <version>
            <version-item>3</version-item>
            <version-item>3</version-item>
            <version-item>6</version-item>
          </version>
        </n3.3>
        <n3.4>
          <date>2015-02-25</date>
          <version>
            <version-item>3</version-item>
            <version-item>4</version-item>
            <version-item>3</version-item>
          </version>
        </n3.4>
      </n3>
    </python>
  </data>
  
Simple?
=======
It's worth just 14 LLOC of a `recursive function 
<https://bitbucket.org/saaj/xmlify/src/fb27d4fe/xmlify/__init__.py#cl-54>`_. The rest ~100 LLOC
is supporting code that goes in line with Pareto principle.

Fast?
=====
.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ python -c 'import os; print(len(os.environ))'
  58
  $ python2.7 -m timeit 'import os,xmlify; xmlify.dumps(os.environ)'
  1000 loops, best of 3: 987 usec per loop
  $ python3.3 -m timeit 'import os,xmlify; xmlify.dumps(os.environ)'
  1000 loops, best of 3: 1.62 msec per loop
  $ pypy -m timeit 'import os,xmlify; xmlify.dumps(os.environ)'
  1000 loops, best of 3: 193 usec per loop
  
Inventing own wheel
===================
NIH was not the case – even though I already had a working code I would happily have used an
existing library that fits my needs. At the Cheese Shop there were several groups of libraries 
that do the same or closely related thing:

* Mappers that need schema up-front
* Libraries that need to build dependencies with OS package dependencies, e.g. lxml
* Marshallers that try to preserve type information, thus making result markup hard to read
* Libraries that build XML tree manually with strings and thus with potential escaping issues
* Just broken

I the end I just decided to package the code I had.
