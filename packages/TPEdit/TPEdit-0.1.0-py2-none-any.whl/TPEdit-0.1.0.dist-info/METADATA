Description: 
        TPEdit
        ------
        
        TPEdit is a XML diff program specifically for the Test Program (TP) files
        created by FTIStudio (by Focused Test, Inc.).
        
        TPEdit is, at the core, an XML diff tool. It can read the XML files generated
        by Focused Test, Inc's FTIStudio program.
        
        Any number of files can be compared simultaneously. However, each compared
        file must hace the same strucutre or else it freaks out. Or more correctly,
        I haven't tested what happens.
        
        **THIS IS NOT A GENERIC XML DIFF TOOL!**
        (though I've thought about making one...)
        
        This tool will only work on XML program files generated by FTIStudio.
