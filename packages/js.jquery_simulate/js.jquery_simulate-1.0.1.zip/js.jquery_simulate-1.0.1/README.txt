js.jquery_simulate
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery.simulate()`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery.simulate()`: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_simulate``) are published to some URL.
