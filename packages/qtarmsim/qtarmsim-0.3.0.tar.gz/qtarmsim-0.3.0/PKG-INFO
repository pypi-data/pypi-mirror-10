Description: Qt ARMSim
        =========
        
        Qt ARMSim is a graphical frontend to the ARMSim ARM simulator. It
        provides an easy to use multiplatform ARM emulation environment that
        has been designed to be used on Computer Architecture Introductory
        courses.
        
        It is based on a previous work of Gloria Edo Piñana, who developed
        `GlSpim <http://lorca.act.uji.es/projects/glspim/>`_ on 2008.  GlSpim
        is the graphical part of what was planned to be a Qt graphical
        interface to the SPIM simulator.
        
        The ARMSim ARM simulator, Copyright (c) 2014-15 by Germán Fabregat,
        is included with Qt ARMSim.  It can be found on the ``armsim/``
        subdirectory.
        
        
        Installing Qt ARMSim and its dependencies
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Qt ARMSim has the following dependencies:
        
          * `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_.
          * `PySide
            <https://pyside.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
        
        On the other hand, ARMSim has the next dependencies:
        
          * `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_.
          * `GCC for ARM <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_.
        
        The next subsections describe how to install Qt ARMSim and its
        dependencies on GNU/Linux and on Windows.
        
        
        Installing Qt ARMSim on GNU/Linux
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The major GNU/Linux distributions provide packages for Python3,
        PySide, and Ruby. Therefore, the GNU/Linux distribution package should
        be used to install this software.
        
        On the other hand, installing GCC for ARM can be achieved either by
        installing a GCC for ARM package provided by the GNU/Linux
        distribution at hand, building a cross-compiling toolchain, or by
        extracting the ``gcc-arm-none-eabi`` ``tar.gz`` for linux32 from the
        `Arduino download page
        <https://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/list>`_ (beware that this
        last option could not be appropriate on linux64 versions).
        
        Finally, Qt ARMSim can be installed using the ``pip3`` command. (If
        after installing ``python3``, ``pip3`` is not available, it can be
        manually installed by downloading `get-pip.py
        <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_, and
        executing the following command: ``sudo python3 get-pip.py``.)
        
        For example, on Ubuntu you can install Qt ARMSim, ARMSim and their
        dependencies using::
        
           $ sudo apt-get install python3-pyside python3-pip
           $ sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
           $ sudo pip3 install qtarmsim
        
        
        On a Gentoo distribution, you can install Qt ARMSim, ARMSim and their
        dependencies using (as root)::
        
           # emerge -av pyside ruby crossdev
           # echo "PORDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage" >> /etc/portage/make.conf
           # crossdev --target arm --ov-output /usr/local/portage
           # pip3 install qtarmsim
        
        
        2.2 Installing Qt ARMSim on Windows
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To install Qt ARMSim, ARMSim, and their dependencies on Windows,
        please follow the next steps:
        
        1. Download and install Python 3 from the `Python download page for
           windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. During the
           installation process, you should say yest to '``Add Python to the
           Windows path``'.
        
        2. Download and install Ruby 2 from `Ruby Installer for Windows page
           <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_. During the installation process,
           make sure to select the '``Add Ruby executables to you PATH``'
           option. (On Windows XP, Ruby 2 versions could fail to start. If
           this is the case, simply install a 1.9 version.)
        
        3. Download GCC ARM cross compiler for Windows from the `Arduino
           download page <https://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/list>`_.
           Open the ``gcc-arm-none-eabi-x.y.y-win32.tar.gz`` file and extract
           the ``gcc-arm-none-eabi`` folder on any path you prefer. (Remember
           your decision, as you will have to configure Qt ARMSim to set the
           ``ARMSim GCC Compiler`` option to
           '``[PATH]\g++_arm_none_eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe``', where
           [PATH] is the path you have used.)
        
        4. Install PySide and Qt ARMSim using the ``pip3`` command. Open a
           Windows console (executing either ``Power Shell`` or ``cmd``,
           depending on your Windows version), and execute the next commands
           (assuming you installed Python 3.4)::
        
              C:\> cd C:\Python34
              C:\Python34> Scripts\pip3 install PySide qtarmsim
        
        
        3. Executing Qt ARMSim
        ----------------------
        
        Simply execute the ``qtarmsim`` command, or click on the corresponding
        entry on the applications menu (on GNU/Linux, under the ``Education``
        category).
        
        
        4. Upgrading Qt ARMSim
        ----------------------
        
        If you want to upgrade an already installed Qt ARMSim, simply execute
        the following command on GNU/Linux::
        
          $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade qtarmsim
           
        Or the equivalent command on Windows::
        
          C:\> pip3 install --upgrade qtarmsim
        
        
        5. Uninstalling Qt ARMSim
        -------------------------
        
        To uninstall Qt ARMSim on GNU/Linux, execute the following command::
        
          $ sudo pip3 uninstall qtarmsim
        
        Or the equivalent command on Windows::
        
          C:\> pip3 uninstall qtarmsim
        
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.3.0 (2015-06-09)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Migrated from PyQt to PySide to allow a simpler installation of Qt
          ARMSim.
        - Developed a new source code editor based on QPlainTextEdit, though
          removing the prior QScintilla dependency, which allows a simpler
          installation of Qt ARMSim.
        - Improved the ARM Assembler syntax highlighting.
        
        
        0.2.7 (2014-11-05)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Last revision of the first functional Qt ARMSim version, as it was
          used on the first semester of an introductory course on Computer
          Architecture at Jaume I University. This version has PyQt and
          QScintilla dependencies.
