Description: **rcontrol**
        ============
        
        **rcontrol** is a python library based on **paramiko** intended to work
        with remote machines via ssh.
        
        Unlike **fabric**, it is intended to perform tasks in an asynchronous way.
        
        Please note that this is under development! I am waiting for feedback,
        ideas and contributors to make this tool evolve.
        
        Basic example: ::
        
          from rcontrol.ssh import SshSession, ssh_client
        
          # create session on two hosts
          bilbo = SshSession(ssh_client('http://bilbo.domain.com', 'user', 'pwd'))
          nazgul = SshSession(ssh_client('http://nazgul.domain.com', 'user', 'pwd'))
        
          # run commands in parallel
          tasks = (bilbo.execute("uname -a && sleep 3"),
                   nazgul.execute("uname -a && sleep 3"))
        
          # wait for both commands to finish
          for task in tasks:
              task.wait()
        
        This example just show you how **rcontrol** looks like.
        
        
        What **rcontrol** can do
        ========================
        
        * execute multiple commands on local and remote hosts in an asynchronous way
          (it is up to you to synchronize them)
        
        * define timeout and output timeout for the commands
        
        * attach callbacks when a line is read (stdout or stderr), on timeout and
          when the commands are finished
        
        * copy files from one host to another
        
        
        What **rcontrol** needs (contributors, you're welcome!)
        =======================================================
        
        * be able to stop (kill) a command (local or remote)
        
        * more file operations (create dirs, recursively copy dirs, remove, ...)
        
        * make it work with python 3
        
        * love
        
        
        How to install
        ==============
        
        Use pip. ::
        
          pip install -U rcontrol
        
Platform: Any
