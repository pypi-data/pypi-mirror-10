    The default mapping from remote to local filenames is to mirror the remote file hierarchy
    on the local disk.  The normal mode of operation is to establish the local root for the
    mirror using the BOSS_LOCAL_ROOT environment variable. When the constructor is called
    with no arguments, it will raise a ValueError if either BOSS_DATA_URL or BOSS_LOCAL_ROOT
    is not set.

    Args:
        data_url(str): Base URL of all BOSS data files. A trailing / on the URL is optional. If
            this arg is None, then the value of the BOSS_DATA_URL environment variable we be
            used instead.
        local_root(str): Local path to use as the root of the locally mirrored file
            hierarchy. If this arg is None, then the value of the BOSS_LOCAL_ROOT environment
            variable, if any, will be used instead.  If a value is provided, it should identify
            an existing writeable directory.

        Downloads are streamed so that the memory requirements are independent of the
        file size. During the download, the file is written to its final location but
        with '.downloading' appended to the file name. This means than any download
        that is interrupted or fails will normally not lead to an incomplete file
        being returned by a subsequent call to :meth:`get`. Instead, the file will
        be re-downloaded. Tere is no facility for resuming a previous partial download.
        After a successful download, the file is renamed to its final location and
        has its permission bits set to read only (to prevent accidental modifications
        of files that are supposed to exactly mirror the remote file system).

            chunk_size(int): Size of data chunks to use for the streaming download. Larger
                sizes will potentially download faster but also require more memory.
