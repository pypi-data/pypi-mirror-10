Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The purpose of this package is to provide an extra verification step for Plone
        when self-registration is enabled.
        
        When you install this product, before a user can register with the Plone site, they
        first must verify they have a valid email address. This done by sending the user
        an email with a unique verification url that includes a randomly generated code.
        
        This is meant to be a proof-of-concept solution. There are no tests and I haven't
        spent a lot of time on it.
        
        Yes, I know very sophisticated spam bots can also automate the email verification
        process. To address that, the next step for this package would be to check the email
        address against database/API with a known list of bad emails/domains(if there is such a thing).
        
        In any case, I'm hoping that this can be a decent OOTB method for protecting Plone's
        self-registration setting.
