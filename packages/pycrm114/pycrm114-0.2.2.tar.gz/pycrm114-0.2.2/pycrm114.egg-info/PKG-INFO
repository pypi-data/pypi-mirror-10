        Python bindings for libcrm114
        
        Quickstart
        ==================
        
        No persistence
        --------------
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pycrm114
        
            crm = pycrm114.CRM114(classes=["spam", "ham"])
            crm.learn("spam", "foo bar")
            crm.learn("ham", "bar is good")
            assert crm.classify("is bar good")["class"] == "ham"
            assert crm.classify("foo bar good")["class"] == "spam"
            crm.forget("spam", "foo bar")
            assert crm.classify("foo bar good")["class"] == "ham"
