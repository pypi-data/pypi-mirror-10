    Internally, this is a set of recursively embedded dicts, with n layers for

    dicts of dicts. More precisely, collections.Counter is used in place of
    dict, making multiset operations valid and allowing unattested n-grams to
    be queried.

    The key at each level is a word. The value at the most deeply embedded
    level is a numeric value representing the frequency of the trigram. E.g.
    the trigram frequency of 'colorless green ideas' would be the value stored
