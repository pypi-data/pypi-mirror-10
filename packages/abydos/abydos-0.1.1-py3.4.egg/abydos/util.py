The util module defines various utility functions for other modules within
Abydos, including:
    prod -- computes the product of a collection of numbers (akin to sum)
    jitter -- adds small random noise to each member of a list of numbers
        (ported from R's jitter function)
    Rational -- a rational number class

        passed as amount).

    Description:
    (adapted from R documentation as this is ported directly from the R code)
    The result, say r, is r = x + numpy.random.uniform(-a, a) where n = len(x)
    and a is the amount argument (if specified).

    Let z = max(x) - min(x) (assuming the usual case). The amount a to be added
    is either provided as positive argument amount or otherwise computed from
    z, as follows:

    If amount == 0, we set a = factor * z/50 (same as S).

    If amount is None (default), we set a = factor * d/5 where d is the
    smallest difference between adjacent unique x values.
