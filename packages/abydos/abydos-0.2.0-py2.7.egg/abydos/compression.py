"""abydos.compression

The compression module defines compression and compression-related functions
for use within Abydos, including implementations of the following:

    - arithmetic coding functions (ac_train, ac_encode, & ac_decode)
    - Burrows-Wheeler transform encoder/decoder (bwt_encode & bwt_decode)
    - Run-Length Encoding encoder/decoder (rle_encode & rle_decode)
