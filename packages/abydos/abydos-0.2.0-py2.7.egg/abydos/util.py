    - prod -- computes the product of a collection of numbers (akin to sum)
    - jitter -- adds small random noise to each member of a list of numbers

    Adapted from R documentation as this is ported directly from the R code:

    The result, say r, is r = x + numpy.random.uniform(-a, a) where n = len(x)
    and a is the amount argument (if specified).

    Let z = max(x) - min(x) (assuming the usual case). The amount a to be added
    is either provided as positive argument amount or otherwise computed from
    z, as follows:

    If amount == 0, we set a = factor * z/50 (same as S).

    If amount is None (default), we set a = factor * d/5 where d is the
    smallest difference between adjacent unique x values.

    Based on:
    http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/R/jitter.R

    :param x:  numeric collection to which jitter should be added
    :param factor:  numeric
    :param amount:  numeric; if positive, used as amount (see below),
        otherwise, if = 0 the default is factor * z/50.
        Default (NULL): factor * d/5 where d is about the smallest difference
        between x values.
    :param min_val: the minimum permitted value in the returned list
    :param max_val: the maximum permitted value in the returned list
    :param rand: a string or function to indicate the random distribution used:
        'normal' (default), 'uniform' (standard in the R version),

        If a function is supplied, it should take one argument (the value
