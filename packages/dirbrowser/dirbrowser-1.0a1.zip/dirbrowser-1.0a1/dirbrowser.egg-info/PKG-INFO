        Bugs and issue tracking
        -----------------------
        
        This module should be platform independent, however testing has to
        date only been performed with Windows 8.1 Pro using cmd.exe. Bug
        reports should be submitted via the github issue tracker.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This module is built for python 3, and is not backwards compatible
        with python 2. 
        
        This module includes a number of functions that provide basic 
        directory browser functionality, in an easy to view format, within a 
        command line environment, e.g. cmd.exe. Using the main function
        browse_dir() allows the user to browse the directory tree and set the
        current working directory. Another function, select_files() can be 
        used to return a list of files within that directory, optionally 
        filtered by file type. 
        
        The display of the directory is formatted as follows, where the 
        ellipsis, '...', represents the parent directory: ::
        
        [0] ...
        [1] Folder1
        [2] File1.py
        [3] File2.txt
        [4] Folder2
        
        Using browse_dir() the children within a directory can be viewed,
        the directory tree traversed, and the working directory set. The
        browse_dir() function is a wrapper for the change_dir() function
        that creates and displays the children of the current directory.
        This is done with with calls to create_child_dict(), which takes a
        list of children and adds to a dictionary object, and 
        display_children() which displays the contents of the dictionary in
        the above format.
        
        The select_files() function displays the file child objects of the
        current working directory, and allows the user to specify whether to
        select all files or a single file, returning a list of the selected 
        file(s). The files viewed using selct_files() can be filtered for a 
        specific file type by preprocessing the file_list object passed to 
        select_files() with the function filter_file_type(), and specifying 
        the file suffix of the files to be returned. Optionally, 
        user_input_file_type(), a wrapper for filter_file_type, prompts the
        user to enter a file type suffix at the command line.
