"""Module that enables basic file/direcotry browser functionality.

dirbrowser version 1.0a1
========================

This module includes a number of functions that provide basic direcotry
browser functionality in an easy to view format within a command 
line environment, e.g. Windows shell. Using the two main functions
browse_dir() and select_files() in combination allows the user
to browse the directory tree and set a working directory, and return
a list of files within that directory, optionally filtered by file
type. This list of files can then be utilised by other scripts.

See README.txt for full documentation.
