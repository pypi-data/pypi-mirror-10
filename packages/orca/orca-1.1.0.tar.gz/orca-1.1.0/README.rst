Orca is a pipeline orchestration tool that allows you to define dynamic data
sources and explicitly connect them to processing functions.
Orca has many features for working with `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__
data structures, but it can be used with anything.

Learn more in the official docs at https://synthicity.github.io/orca/.
