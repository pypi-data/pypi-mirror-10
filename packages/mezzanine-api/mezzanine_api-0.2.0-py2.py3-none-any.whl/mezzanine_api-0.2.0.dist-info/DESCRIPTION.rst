========
Overview
========
Mezzanine API is a RESTful web API built using the `Django`_ framework which extends the `Mezzanine`_ content
management platform. The API empowers developers to automate, extend and combine Mezzanine with other services such as
Ember.js or a mobile app.

Features
========
* REST API resources for posts, pages, users, and categories
* Apply filters and search queries to narrow down results
* OAuth 2.0 allows users to authorize and revoke access to third party applications without the need for those
  applications to request the user's credentials
* Web browsable API
* Endpoints documented with `Swagger UI`_
* Leverages `Django Rest Framework`_

Roadmap
========
* More endpoints
* Refinement
* Writeable API access
* Test Suite
* Further documentation for configuration and customization

Installation
============
1. Install from PyPI::

    $ pip install mezzanine-api

2. Add the following apps to INSTALLED_APPS in your Mezzanine settings.py::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'mezzanine_api',
        'rest_framework',
        'rest_framework_swagger',
        'oauth2_provider',
    )

3. Also, add the following lines at the end of your settings.py module::

    #####################
    # REST API SETTINGS #
    #####################
    try:
        from mezzanine_api.settings import *
    except ImportError as e:
        pass

4. Add the following code in your Mezzanine urls.py somewhere after the ``urlpatterns = []`` line::

    # REST API URLs
    urlpatterns += patterns("",
        ("^api/", include("mezzanine_api.urls")),
    )

5. Migrate the database to support Oauth2::

    $ python manage.py migrate

6. Start the server::

    $ python manage.py runserver

7. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/ to view the endpoint documentation and query the API.
