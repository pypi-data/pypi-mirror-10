v0,   4/20/15 -- Initial release.
v1,   4/27/15 -- Cut time dimension from unlimited size to size of ASCII file.
                 This cut made netCDF files smaller.
                 Test files have been updated to include this change.
v1.1, 4/29/15 -- Revamped test Parser to include an increasing set of test files.
                 Created comments and decreased frequency of long lines
                 Also cleans up directory when finished.
v1.2, 5/18/15 -- Finished test for writer class. 
                 Commented and few long lines.
                 Cleans up directory when execution finishes.
                 Created a python module that autoruns every 5-6 seconds and
                 updates new netCDF file. It's still buggy though.

v1.3, 5/19/15 -- Fixed bug in autoWrite.
                 Will not crash with an Index Error.
                 In tester interface, prompting user for path was moved:
                 it is now a function.

v1.4, 5/19/15 -- Placed autorun into temp folder to be trashed later.
                 Easier way to autorun program was found.
                 Upgraded Util to a class where it autogenerates paths and
                 dates.
                 Write class only focuses on writing.
                 Parser class only focuses on returning set of frames.
                 Got rid of user interface in tester. Tester just writes
                 range of files.
                 Planning to add a method which writes yesterday's files.

v1.5, 5/20/15 -- Created new autorun script
                 Tester renamed bundler. Equipped bundler with move function
                 and convert yesterday's file function.
                 Writer now takes only a dictionary of frames as a parameter
                 and a date - just in case there were no frames for that date.
                 Util can now generate the datetime object for yesterday.
                 README.txt updated to fit new implementation of bundler.

v1.6, 5/21/15 -- created bash autorun wrapped around python auto run script.

v1.7, 5/22/15 -- Finished writing unit tests for the scripts.
