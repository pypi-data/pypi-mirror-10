The Aoss_Tower_a1_Conversion  package takes the ascii data in aosstower 
and converts them into netcdf4 files. This conversion allows calibration 
factors to be applied and converted to geophysical units.

Typical usage looks like:

from datetime import datetime as date
from convertFromASCIIToNETCDF import bundler

#enter some date time obj
myDatetime = datetime(2003, 06, 05, 0, 0, 0)
myDatetime2 = datetime(2004, 05, 14, 0, 0, 0)
bundler.writeRange(myDateTime, myDateTime2)

Bundler can either convert a range of ascii files based upon a start or 
end date, or from 2003-05-28 to the present day (all ascii files). 
All paths and date formats are generated by the Util class.
If user wants to modify them, they need to do so by changing Util's
values.
