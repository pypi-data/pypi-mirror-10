simdeplower is a python tool that you can use to deploy vCenter Server Appliances and have them
magically configured in simulator mode (or how ever you see fit using a shell script).

Getting Started
===============
simdeplower has been tested extensively on OSX, but should work anywhere that subprocess32 and paramiko will run.
simdeplower requires either VMWare Workstation or Fusion to be successful. From those products simdeplower will use
vmrun and ovftool. simdeplower uses ovftool to deploy (extract) an ova onto the filesystem then uses vmrun to launch
the extracted VMX. Once the VM is up and running simdeplower uses paramiko to ssh in using the default username and
password of "root" and "vmware" and executes a shell script you provide, or a bundled script that will configure the
appliance as a simulator. This only works on VCSA 5.x products because simulator no longer works on 6.x


Installing
==========
To install it is best to create a new virtualenv and install using pip
