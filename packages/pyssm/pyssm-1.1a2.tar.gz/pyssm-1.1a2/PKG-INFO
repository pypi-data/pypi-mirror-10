        PySSM is a Python package that has been developed for the analysis of
        time series using linear Gaussian state space models (SSM).
        
        PySSM is easy to use; models can be set up quickly and efficiently and
        a variety of different settings are available to the user.  It also
        takes advantage of scientific libraries Numpy and Scipy and other
        high level features of the Python language.
        
        PySSM default is also used as a platform for interfacing between
        optimised and parallelised FORTRAN routines.  These FORTRAN routines
        heavily utilise Basic Linear Algebra (BLAS) and Linear Algebra Package
        (LAPACK) functions for maximum performance.
        
        PySSM contains classes for filtering, classical smoothing as well as
        simulation smoothing.
