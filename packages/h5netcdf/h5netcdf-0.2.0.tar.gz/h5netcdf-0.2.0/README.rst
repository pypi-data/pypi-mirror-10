A Python interface for the netCDF4_ file-format that reads and writes HDF5
files API directly via h5py_, without relying on the Unidata netCDF library.

.. _netCDF4: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/NetCDF_002d4-Format.html
.. _h5py: http://www.h5py.org/

**This is an experimental project.** It currently passes basic tests for
reading and writing netCDF4 files with Python, but it has not been tested for
compatibility with other netCDF4 interfaces.

Motivations
-----------

Why did I write h5netcdf? Well, here are a few reasons:

- To prove it could be done (it seemed like an obvious thing to do) and that
  netCDF4 is not actually that complicated.
- We've seen occasional reports of better performance with h5py than
  netCDF4-python that I wanted to be able to verify. For `some workflows`_,
  **h5netcdf has been reported to be almost 4x faster than netCDF4-python**.
- h5py seems to have thought through multi-threading pretty carefully, so this
  in particular seems like a case where things could make a difference. I've
  started to care about this because I recently hooked up a multi-threaded
  backend to xray_.
- It's one less massive binary dependency (netCDF C). Anecdotally, HDF5 users
  seem to be unexcited about switching to netCDF -- hopefully this will
  convince them that they are really the same thing!
- Finally, side-stepping the netCDF C library (and Cython bindings to it)
  gives us an easier way to identify the source of performance issues and
  bugs.

Install
-------

Ensure you have h5py installed (I recommend using conda_). Then: ``pip
install h5netcdf``

.. _conda: http://conda.io/

Usage
-----

h5netcdf has two APIs, a new API and a legacy API.

New API
~~~~~~~

The new API supports direct hierarchical access of variables and groups. It's
design is an adaptation of h5py to the netCDF data model. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import h5netcdf
    import numpy as np

    with h5netcdf.File('mydata.nc', 'w') as f:
        v = f.create_variable('/grouped/data', ('x',), data=np.arange(10))
        v.attrs['foo'] = 'bar'
        print(f['/grouped/data'])

**Warning: The design of the new API is *not yet stable*.** I only
recommended using it for experiments. Please share your feedback in `this
GitHub issue`_.

Legacy API
~~~~~~~~~~

The legacy API is designed for compatibility with netCDF4-python_. To use it, import
``h5netcdf.legacyapi``:

.. _netCDF4-python: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python

.. code-block:: python

    import h5netcdf.legacyapi as netCDF4
    # everything here would also work with this instead:
    # import netCDF4
    import numpy as np

    with netCDF4.Dataset('mydata.nc', 'w') as ds:
        ds.createDimension('x', 10)
        g = ds.createGroup('grouped')
        g.createVariable('data', 'i8', ('x',))
        v = g['data']
        v[...] = np.arange(10)
        v.foo = 'bar'
        print(ds.groups['grouped'].variables['data'])
