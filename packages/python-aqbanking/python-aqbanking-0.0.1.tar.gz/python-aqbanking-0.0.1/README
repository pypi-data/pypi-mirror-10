This is a python wrapper for AqBanking - so of course you need the AqBanking and Gwenhywfar dependencies 
installed for a successful compilation. The only supported things at the moment: get balance of an account, 
get the transactions of an account (with limitation to start and end date), list configured accounts in 
AqBanking, check an IBAN.
