This is an example Python package, which is intended to illustrate the current
best practices in Python development and packaging.  The intended audience is
for Bioinformatics, so the package itself simulates a Kingman's coalescent, a
simple but fundamental process in population genetics. See the `CodeMonkeys
blog post <http://wtchgcodemonkeys.github.io/Packaging_Python/>`_ for a full
discussion of this package.
