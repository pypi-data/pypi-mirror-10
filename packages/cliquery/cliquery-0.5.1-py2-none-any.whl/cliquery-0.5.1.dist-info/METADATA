# cliquery

## a command-line browsing interface
cliquery is a command-line interface meant to bundle important features of a conventional browser and the quickness of the command-line. It supports previewing webpages, bookmarks, 'Feeling Lucky' searches, as well as regular web searches or simply entering URI's directly. cliquery is **_NOT_** a command-line browser such as Lynx, but it does have an interactive interface that makes it quick and easy to perform multiple searches and other operations. When a user decides to actually open a link, cliquery simply invokes their browser of choice! Supported in both Python 2.x and 3.x.

The results? Less clicking, faster results, and *no limitations to regular browsing!*

## Installation
* `pip install cliquery`
* [Sign up (optional)](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) for a WolframAlpha API key.
* Enter your API key and choice of browser in .cliqrc (cygwin users should enter `cygwin` as their browser). An example .rc file is available in cliquery/.cliqrc, or will be created after an initial run. The API key field may be left blank if you did not sign up for a key.

## Usage
usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-s] [-f] [-o] [-w] [-d] [-b] [-v] [QUERY [QUERY ...]]

a command-line browsing interface

&nbsp;&nbsp;positional arguments:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUERY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keywords to search


&nbsp;&nbsp;optional arguments:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-h, --help&nbsp;&nbsp;show this help message and exit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-s, --search&nbsp;&nbsp;display search links

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-f, --first&nbsp;&nbsp;open first link

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-o, --open&nbsp;&nbsp;open link or browser manually

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-w, --wolfram&nbsp;display wolfram results

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-d, --describe&nbsp;display page snippet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-b, --bookmark&nbsp;view and modify bookmarks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-c, --config&nbsp;print location of config file

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-v, --version&nbsp;display current version

## Notes
* If you receive the following message when trying to add bookmarks:
    ```
    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'
    ```
Enter the following to fix:
    ```
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc
    ```

* A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

* Interactive use is as easy as passing the regular flag arguments into the link prompt; this overrides any preexisting flags and allows for more even more flexibility.

* Entering h or help will bring up the list of possible commands to pass to the prompt.

* To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be the same as entering 5-10.

* Using the bookmarks flag with no arguments will list all current bookmarks in .cliqrc, ordered by time of entry. Adding and deleting bookmarks can be done using add [url] or del [num] or [suburl], where [suburl] is a substring of the url. Opening bookmarks is done through the bookmarks flag and either a [num] or [suburl] argument. Bookmarks may also be added interactively through the link prompt, like all other flags.
