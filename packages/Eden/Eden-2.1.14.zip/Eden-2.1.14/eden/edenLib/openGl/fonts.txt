Create a texture atlas containing all chars.
Getting a char means getting its atlas coords (pos and size).
The render each char to the appropriate substrate coords.

Chars come from a dict:

{<char>: <pos>, <size>}

Rendering chars to a surface with constant size means that texture coords (m) are given with respect to denormalized surface coords (m).
