1. Denormalize bounding box by multiplying it with the size matrix
2. Get multiple lines of text with absolute character size
3. Compute character cell vertex locations in the denormalized bounding box
Each cell should have 4 vertices, which are not shared with the next cell
4. Assign the 4 normalized texture coordinates of the appropriate character to the 4 cell vertices.
5. Homogenize the cell coordinates and multiply them by the homogenized translation x rotation matrix. 
6. Set the core memory for each cell.
7. Render.
