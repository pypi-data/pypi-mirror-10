Quick start
===========

`neon <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon>`__ is NErvana's pythON
based Deep Learning Framework! We have designed it with the following
functionality in mind:

-  YAML for easy model specification (inspired by
   `pylearn2 <https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2>`__)
-  Python for easy model hacking and support for many data formats
-  Support for commonly used models: convnets, MLPs, RNNs, LSTMs,
   autoencoders, RBMs
-  Support for common learning rules, activation functions and cost
   functions
-  Comparing performance of alternate numeric representations with fp32
   for Deep Learning
-  Support for using
   `spearmint <https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint>`__ for
   hyperparameter optimization
-  Swappable hardware backends: write code once and then deploy on CPUs,
   GPUs, or Nervana hardware

Features that are unique to neon include:

-  Tight integration with
   `nervanagpu <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/nervanagpu>`__ kernels
   for fp16 and fp32
   (`benchmarks <https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks>`__) on
   Maxwell GPUs. These are the fastest implementations of the benchmark
   deep networks.
-  4.3s/macrobatch on AlexNet on Titan X (Full run on 1 GPU ~ 45 hrs)
-  Out of the box `fp16 AlexNet
   model <examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp16.yaml>`__ that has the same
   accuracy as `fp32 <examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp32.yaml>`__
-  Integration with our fork
   (`cudanet <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/cuda-convnet2>`__) of
   Alex Krizhevsky's cuda-convnet2 library for Kepler GPU support
-  Support for our distributed processor (Nervana Engine™) for deep
   learning.

We use neon internally at Nervana to solve our customers' problems
across many `domains <http://www.nervanasys.com/products/>`__. We are
hiring across several roles. Apply
`here <http://www.nervanasys.com/careers/>`__!

Getting started
---------------

Basic information to get started is below. Please consult the `full
documentation <http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest>`__ for more
information.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Local install and
   dependencies <http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html>`__
-  Cloud-based access (`email us <mailto:demo@nervanasys.com>`__ for an
   account)

Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a Mac OSX or Linux box enter the following to download and install
neon, and use it to train your first multi-layer perceptron or
convolutional neural networks below.

::

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    sudo make install

The above will install neon system-wide.  If you don't have sufficient
privileges or would prefer an isolated installation, see our `virtualenv
<http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html#virtualenv>`__
based install.

There are several examples built-in to neon in the ``examples``
directory for a user to get started. The YAML format is plain-text and
can be edited to change various aspects of the model. See the
`ANNOTATED\_EXAMPLE.yaml
<https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/blob/master/examples/ANNOTATED_EXAMPLE.yaml>`__
for some of the definitions and possible choices.

Running a simple MNIST model (on CPU)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    neon examples/mlp/mnist-small.yaml

Running an Alexnet model (on GPU)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In `fp32 <examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp32.yaml>`__:

::

    # for nervangpu (requires Maxwell GPUs)
    neon --gpu nervanagpu examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp32.yaml

    # for cudanet (works with Kepler or Maxwell GPUs)
    neon --gpu cudanet examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp32.yaml

In `fp16 <examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp16.yaml>`__:

::

    neon --gpu nervanagpu examples/convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp16.yaml

   <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/issues>`__ to see if we're already
   working on what you have uncovered.
#. Check that your issue/request has not already been addressed in our
   `Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   <http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/faq.html>`__
#. File a new `issue <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/issues>`__ or

   if you have some code you'd like to contribute.

Machine learning OPerations (MOP) Layer
---------------------------------------
The `MOP <http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/ml_operational_layer.html>`__
is an abstraction layer for Nervana's system software and
hardware which includes the Nervana Engine, a custom distributed
processor for deep learning.

The MOP consists of linear algebra and other operations required by deep
learning. Some MOP operations are currently exposed in neon, while others,
such as distributed primitives, will be exposed in later versions as well as
in other forthcoming Nervana libraries.

Defining models in a MOP-compliant manner guarantees they will run on all
provided backends. It also provides a way for existing Deep Learning frameworks
such as `theano <https://github.com/Theano/Theano>`__,
`torch <https://github.com/torch/torch7>`__, and
`caffe <https://github.com/BVLC/caffe>`__ to interface with the Nervana Engine.

Upcoming libraries
------------------

We have separate, upcoming efforts on the following fronts:

-  Distributed models
-  Automatic differentiation
-  Integration with Nervana Cloud™
