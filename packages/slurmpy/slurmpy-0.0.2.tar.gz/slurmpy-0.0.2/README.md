quick and dirty lib for submitting jobs to slurm via python.

```Python
from slurm import Slurm

s = Slurm("job-name", {"account": "my-account", "partition": "my-parition"})
s.run("""
do
lots
of
stuff
""")

```

The above will submit the job to `sbatch` automatically write the script to `scripts/`
and automatically write logs/{name}.err and logs/{name}.out

It uses a template by default, but can be overriden with the kwargs dict as above.

The script to run() can also be a template which is filled with the cmd_kwarg dict.
