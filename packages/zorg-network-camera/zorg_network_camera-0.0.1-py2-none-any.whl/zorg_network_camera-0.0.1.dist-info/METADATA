Zorg Network Camera
===================

This module contains device adaptors and drivers that make it possible
to connect network cameras to your robot.

Network Camera Adaptor
----------------------

This module's network camera adaptor handles the basic functions of
retrieving images from the remote camera when necessary. Because this
module is intended to run on devices such as the Intel Edison or the
Raspberry Pi, the adaptor has been designed with additional features for
efficiency. Mainly, if an images are cached until the image from the
remote camera has been updated. This ensures that an image will not be
unnecessarily downloaded onto the device.

Camera Feed Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Feed`` module provides a driver for accessing the url to of the
remote camera's image. This is a convenience method intended to be used
to load the image into your application.

Light Sensor Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``LightSensor`` module allows you to use the camera as a light
sensor. This driver provides the ability to get the average lighting
level from the camera.
