     What is electricity?

      <li>
       Flow of charged particles (in this curriculum, we

       Water analogy – Flow of water through a
            completely filled pipe is highly similar (in intuitive
            basis and in equations) for many of the electrical
            concepts. Many electronics components can be modeled
            with analogous water based structures that are
            intuitively easy to understand. A brief list of
            concepts about electricity in a wire can be explained
            by analogy to water in a pipe:

     Demonstration: LED throwie (with resistor) – one of
          the simplest circuits
     <ul>
      <li>
       Build the circuit as shown, using your hands. This
            can be done by pinching one lead of the the resistor
            and one lead of the LED around the battery with the
            left hand, and pinch the remaining LED and resistor
            leads together with the right hand.
      </li>
      <li>
       Note: Current will only flow through the LED in one
            direction, therefore you must connect it up correctly
            (no harm done if you don't, but it won't work). The
            cathode of the LED (has the shorter lead, and has a
            flat side) should be connected to the negative side of
            the battery.
      </li>
      <li>
       Note: An LED throwie can be made without the
            resistor, however it is considered bad practice to do
            so as it either it can possibly damage either the
            battery or LED (the resistor is used to limit the
            current through the circuit to a reasonable level).
            But, as the LED throwies are often only temporarily,
            they are often made without the resistor. In this
            exercise, though, it makes sense to teach the proper
            way to connect up an LED.

     Assemble the RaspberrySTEM™ CREATOR Lid
     <ul>
      <li>
       Attach the Connector PCB to to the Lid with two
            nuts and bolts. The bolts should be pointed
            upwards.
      </li>
      <li>
       Attach the CREATOR Lid to the Raspberry Pi with the
            ribbon cable.
      </li>
      <li>
       Snap the Lid onto the RaspberrySTEM™
            Base.

     </ul>
     Building Your First Circuit on a Breadboard
     <ul>
      <li>
       Connect the 3.3V power and ground (GND) from the
            CREATOR Lid Connector to the breadboard power rails.
            The 3.3V should be hooked up to the positive
            “+” (red) rail, and the GND should be
            hooked up to the negative “-” (blue)
            rail.
      </li>
      <li>
       Build the circuit as shown in the previous example,
            in two steps:
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
       <ul>
        <li>
         First, plug the resistor/LED connection into a
                single 5-pin column of the breadboard (previously
                held with the right hand). Continue to hold the
                left hand with the battery. The LED should light
                up.
        </li>
        <li>
         Second, remove the battery and instead hook the
                leads that were connected to the battery to the
                positive and negative. The LED should light
                up.
