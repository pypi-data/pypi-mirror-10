       Discover how to connect an LED Matrix to the
            Raspberry Pi. The LED Matrix is a grid of 8 by 8 red
            LEDs that can be individually lit at different
            intensities, and forms the basis of a simple display.
            The LED Matrix can be used for games, a clock, text
            displays, histogram displays and many other uses.

     What is the LED Matrix RaspberrySTEM™ Cell?
     <br>
      It consists of:
      <ul>
       <li>
        A LED Matrix driver PCB – a circuit board,
            that receives data from the Raspberry Pi, and displays
            it on an LED Matrix using a small low-power
            micro-controller (Atmel ATTiny48
       </li>
       <li>
        An LED Matrix – a grid of LEDs, where for
            each row the anode (positive-side) of the LEDs are
            connected together. LED matrices can only show one
            unique row of LEDs lit at one time, therefore the
            micro-controller is required to sequence through each
            row one at a time. This occurs faster than the eye can
            perceive (through the eye's persistence of vision), and
            therefore appears to be a solid image.
       </li>
       <li>
        Communication from the Raspberry Pi to the LED
            Matrix RaspberrySTEM™ Cell occurs over the SPI
            bus
       </li>
       <li>
        The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a common
            interface for sending data between processors and other
            ICs.
       </li>
       <li>
        The micro-controller stores the brightness level of
            each LED, on a scale from 0-15. In order to update the
            full LED Matrix display, the Raspberry Pi must send 64
            (i.e., 8 x 8) brightness levels, one for each LED, to
            the LED Matrix RaspberrySTEM™ Cell.
