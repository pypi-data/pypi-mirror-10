     What is a GPIO?
     <ul>
      <li>
       General Purpose Input/Output.
      </li>
      <li>
       A method for a computer to get or set the voltage
            (to high (3.3V) or low (0V, i.e. Ground) on a pin.
            Great for turning LEDS on/off, enabling devices (like
            other ICs, motors, relays, etc), or reading the state
            of sensors, buttons, switches, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
       GPIO pin numbers are labelled on the
            RaspberrySTEM™ Lid Connector.

     Hook up and light an LED
     <ul>
      <li>
       Choose any GPIO pin on the RaspberrySTEM™ Lid
            Connector. The GPIO Pin numbers are written as the
            first number next to each pin (not all pins are GPIO
            pins).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Connect up the circuit as shown. GPIO 14 is used in
            this example, but any other GPIO could be used as
            well.
      </li>

       Run the following program. The first line
            initializes the GPIO software. The Output() function
            makes the selected GPIO pin an output pin. The final
            line is the critical line - it turns the GPIO on (and
            the LED will go on as a result).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <pre class="code">
from rstem.gpio import Output<br><br>led = Output(14)<br>led.on()<br>
</br></br></br></br></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>
       To turn the LED off, you can modify the "on" to
            "off". Rerun the program - this will turn the GPIO off,
            which turns the LED off.

     Functions
     <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Functions are a named section of a program.
       </li>
       <li>
        Functions a grouped together in collections called
            libraries.
       </li>
       <li>
        Functions are passed a list of parameters that
            change how the function works.
       </li>
       <li>
        The sleep function, that is part of the time
            library, pauses for the amount of time given. It is
            called with
        <code>
         time.sleep(seconds)
        </code>
        .
       </li>
      </ul>
     </br>

    </div>
    <div class="body">
     <ul>
      <li>
       Use the time.sleep() function to flash an LED. The
            sleep function pauses the program for the amount
            seconds you give it as a parameter.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       To use the sleep function, you'll need to add the
            following line to the top of your program:
      </li>
     </ul>
     <pre class="code">
import time<br>
</br></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>
       As an example, to sleep for two seconds, run:
      </li>
     </ul>
     <pre class="code">
time.sleep(2)<br>
</br></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Change the previous program: Turn the LED ON, sleep
            for one second, turn the LED OFF, sleep for one
            second
      </li>
      <li>
       Repeat the above multiple times, and the LED with
            flash.
      </li>
      <li>
       The sleep function accepts fractional values as
            well - to sleep for half a second, you can use:
      </li>
     </ul>
     <pre class="code">
time.sleep(0.5)<br>
</br></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Decrease the amount of time to have the LED flash
            faster.
      </li>
     </ul>

     Simple loops:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Loops are used to run a section of code for a
            specific number of times.
      </li>
      <li>
       All code that is part of the loop must be indented
            to the same level

     Loops allow a program to run the same section of code
          multiple times. The simplest loop is a
     <code>
      for
     </code>
     loop that runs a specific number of times.
     <ul>
      <li>
       Open a new file.
      </li>
      <li>
       To print the word 'hello' five times, you can
            use:
      </li>
     </ul>
     <pre class="code">
for i in range(5):<br>    print('hello')<br>
</br></br></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The variable i in the above loop increases by one
            each time the loop is run, starting at 0. To see the
            value of i each loop, print it.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Finally, flash the LED 10 times by adding a for
            loop to the previous program.

       Write a program to flash each LED, in an
