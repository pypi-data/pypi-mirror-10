What is ConfigMaster?
---------------------

| ConfigMaster is a simple library for accessing config files
  programmatically. No longer will you have to mess with list lookups
  and dict lookups when you wish to load a config file.
| Instead, objects in the file are accessed as simple class attributes.

What is supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| ConfigMaster natively supports JSON and YAML formats.
| The recommended format is YAML.

TODO
~~~~

-  [STRIKEOUT:Add in support for python ConfigParser formats] *Added in
   version 1.4.0*
-  [STRIKEOUT:Add in networked JSON support] *Added in version 1.3.0*
-  Add more docstrings
-  Make proper documentation
-  [STRIKEOUT:Add tests] *Added in version 1.3.1*

How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| For the latest stable version uploaded to PyPI, use:
| ``pip install configmaster``

| For the latest stable version uploaded to bitbucket, use:
| ``pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/SunDwarf/configmaster``

| For the latest dev version, use:
| ``pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/SunDwarf/configmaster@dev``

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

ConfigMaster handles everything for you. Simply specify the location of
your file, and the values will be automatically loaded for you.

::

    >>> from configmaster import YAMLConfigFile  
    >>> cfg = YAMLConfigFile.YAMLConfigFile("test.yml") # Created automatically if it doesn't exist  

To access config values, simply get the attribute you want from the
config object stored.

::

    # YAML data is {"a": 1, "b": [1, 2], "c": {"d": 3}}  
    >>> cfg.config.a  
    1  
    >>> cfg.config.b[1]  
    2  
    >>> cfg.config.c.d  
    3    

To populate your config data, just pass a dict to initial\_populate. If
the file is empty, this gives it default values, and returns True. If it
isn't, nothing happens.

::

    >>> pop = cfg.initial_populate({"a": 1, "b": [1, 2], "c": {"d": 3})
    >>> if pop: cfg.dump() and cfg.reload() # Dump data and reload from disk.

To save your data, simply run .dump().

::

    >>> cfg.dump()

Need to get the raw dict form of a ConfigKey? Use .dump() on that!

::

    >>> cfg.config.dump()
    {"a": 1, "b": [1, 2], "c": {"d": 3}
    >>> cfg.config.c.dump()
    {"d": 3}
