&lt;p&gt;Footprints for common components used in our projects and products.  This is the same library that we use internally, and it is regularly updated.  The newest version can always be found at &lt;b&gt;www.microBuilder.eu&lt;/b&gt;.  If you find this library useful, please feel free to purchase something from our online store. Please also note that all holes are optimised for metric drill bits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Obligatory Warning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it probably goes without saying, there are no guarantees that the footprints or schematic symbols in this library are flawless, and we make no promises of fitness for production, prototyping or any other purpose. These libraries are provided for information puposes only, and are used at your own discretion.  While we make every effort to produce accurate footprints, and many of the items found in this library have be proven in production, we can't make any promises of suitability for a specific purpose. If you do find any errors, though, please feel free to contact us at www.microbuilder.eu to let us know about it so that we can update the library accordingly!&lt;/p&gt;
