Description: ************************************
        Quarry: a Minecraft protocol library
        ************************************
        
        Write your own bots, servers, proxies, etc!
        
        - Quarry fully implements the design of the minecraft protocol - packet
          structure, modes, compression, etc.
        - Quarry implements only a handful of packet types; enough to get you through
          the login sequence both client- and server-side. This includes talking to
          the Mojang session servers and setting up encryption.
        - Any `other packets`_ you're interested in you'll need to implement yourself.
          Quarry gives you support for some Minecraft data types and reasonably robust
          error checking.
        
        ========
        Examples
        ========
        
        The distribution includes a few example uses of the ``quarry`` module. From
        the root of this repository, you can:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # List examples
            $ python -m examples
        
            # Run an example
            $ python -m examples.blah
        
        If you have ``quarry`` in your python search path, you can run the example
        files directly.
        
        -------
        Clients
        -------
        
        - **Pinger**: Connects to a server and retrieves the MOTD, player count, etc
        - **Player lister**: Joins a server and prints the player list to console.
        - **Chat logger**: Joins a server and prints in-game chat to console while
          rotating creepily (thanks c45y for the idea)
        
        -------
        Servers
        -------
        
        - **Downtime server**: Kicks players with the MOTD when they try to connect.
          Useful for when you want players to know that your usual server is down for
          maintenance etc.
        - **Auth server**: Authenticate players with the mojang session server, then
          kicks them. Sseful for server websites that ask users for a valid Minecraft
          account.
        
        -------
        Proxies
        -------
        
        - **Quiet proxy**: Lets users turn on "quiet" mode that hides chat from the
          server
