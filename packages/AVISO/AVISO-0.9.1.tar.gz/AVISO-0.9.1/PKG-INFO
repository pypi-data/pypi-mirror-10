        A small library to download data from AVISO. It uses the AVISO's DAP server, to
        optimize the use of the net, downloading only the selected subset. For that,
        you need to register a username and password at AVISO. It's free. The data is
        downloaded in blocks, so don't overload AVISO's server, and run safe in unstable
        networks.
        
        Fast aviso howto
        ----------------
        
        Run this in the shell, outside Python, to install the library:
        
        pip install aviso
        
        Now try this, with proper username and password, to download some data into a NetCDF file:
        
        AVISO_download -R -5/310/15/350 -D 1999-01-01/1999-06-01 -u user_at_AVISO_DAP -p password_at_AVISO_DAP --map='msla' --timestep=30 -o aviso.nc
