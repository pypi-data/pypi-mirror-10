# Flask-Pyco

*Flask-Pyco* is a simple flat file CMS inspired by [Pico](http://picocms.org/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Flask-Pyco is an extension of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

There are two example sites in the *examples* folder. One simple and the Flask-Pyco version of my Jekyll blog.
