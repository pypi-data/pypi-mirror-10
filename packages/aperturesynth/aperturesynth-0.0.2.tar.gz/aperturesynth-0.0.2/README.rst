ApertureSynth is a command line tool for registering and combining
multiple photographs to form a single photograph with better properties.
It can be used to:

1. Reduce noise by averaging, even in handheld photos.
2. Simulate a longer exposure than would otherwise be possible using a
   handheld camera.
3. Control the location of the focal plane, including tilt shift effects
   (though further optimisation is needed to handle this nicely.)

Note that aperturesynth is currently experimental and is definitely to
be used at your own risk.

Usage
=====

1. Take a series of photos in burst mode.

2. If shooting in raw format, convert the raw files into a format
   handled by PIL, such as png, tiff or jpeg. Note that it's best to
   avoid noise reduction and sharpening at this point. You might have a
   series of photos 1.png, 2.png, 3.png.

3. Run the command line application on the series of photographs

   ::

       aperturesynth combine --out fused.tiff 1.png 2.png 3.png

   This will fuse the three png images and save the result to
   fused.tiff. The file 1.png will be the baseline image used to
   register 2.png and 3.png.

4. The baseline image (1.png) will appear in a window. Indicate the in
   focus regions by selecting the top left and bottom right of each
   rectangular focal patch. Consecutive pairs of points define each
   rectangular window, the last point of an odd number of points will be
   ignored. You can right click to undo a selection.

5. Press enter when done to begin the fusion process.

For additional help and to see all the options run:

    aperturesynth --help

Installation
============

This software is written in Python, and currently requires a working
Python implementation to run. If you have a working Python installation
you should be able to install aperturesynth by running:

::

    pip install aperturesynth

Alternatively you can install from source. First clone the project from
the website using fossil
` <https://hames.id.au/software/aperturesynth>`__, then run the setup.py
in the root directory to install the file.

::

    fossil clone https://hames.id.au/software/aperturesynth aperturesynth.fossil
    mkdir aperturesynth; cd aperturesynth
    fossil open ../aperturesynth.fossil
    python setup.py install

Either of these options should result in the installation of a
commandline tool called aperturesynth.

Changes
=======

0.0.2
-----

-  The type of transform is now chosen based on the number of focal
   regions specified. This allows registration of only one or two
   points, instead of always requiring three or more.
-  The commandline syntax has changed to allow multiple subcommands,
   including a new way of saving and loading the focal region locations
   to/from a file.

0.0.1
-----

-  Initial proof of concept.
