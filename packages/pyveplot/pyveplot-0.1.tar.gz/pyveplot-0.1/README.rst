# Pyveplot

[Hiveplots](http://www.hiveplot.com/) are a nice way of visualizing a
complex network.

This library uses
[svgwrite](http://svgwrite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/classes/shapes.html)
to programbatically create hiveplots..

In the following example I've used a network created using
[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/), but there is no dependency to
it.
