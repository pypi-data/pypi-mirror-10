==============
SparklingPandas
==============

SparklingPandas aims to make it easy to use the distributed computing power
of PySpark to scale your data analysis with Pandas.

Documentation
=========

None (right now). You can find some slides in the slides/ directory

Requirements
=========

The primary requirement of SparklingPandas is that you have a recent (v1.3
currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org> and Python
2.7.

Using
=========

Make sure you have the SPARK_HOME enviroment variable set correctly, as
SparklingPandas uses this for including the PySpark libraries

Other than that you can install SparklingPandas with pip and just import it.
The primary unit of SparklingPandas is a PRDD (Pandas Resillent Distributed
Data Set)

State
=========

This is in early development and should not be considered usable.
