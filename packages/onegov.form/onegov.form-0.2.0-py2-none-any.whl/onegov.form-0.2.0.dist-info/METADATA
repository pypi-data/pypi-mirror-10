Provides fields, widgets and shared form code, as well as the ability to
define custom forms using JSON. Those forms are stored on the database and
are meant to be customer defined forms.

Through the web creating of forms is possible with this, but onegov.form does
not offer any UI to do that.

Changelog

Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

0.2.0 (2015-05-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rewrites most of the parsing logic. Pyparsing is no longer used for
  indentation, instead the form source is transalted into YAML first, then
  parsed further.

  This fixes all known indentation problems.
