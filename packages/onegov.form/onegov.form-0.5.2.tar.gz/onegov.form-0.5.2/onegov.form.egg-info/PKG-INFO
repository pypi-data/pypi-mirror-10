Description: 
        
        Provides fields, widgets and shared form code, as well as the ability to
        define custom forms using JSON. Those forms are stored on the database and
        are meant to be customer defined forms.
        
        Through the web creating of forms is possible with this, but onegov.form does
        not offer any UI to do that.
        
        Run the Tests
        -------------

        Limit the tests to a specific python version::
        
            tox -e py27
        
        Conventions
        -----------
        
        Onegov Form follows PEP8 as close as possible. To test for it run::
        
            tox -e pep8

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          [href]
        
        0.2.2 (2015-05-29)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        - Rewrites most of the parsing logic. Pyparsing is no longer used for
          indentation, instead the form source is transalted into YAML first, then
          parsed further.
        
          This fixes all known indentation problems.
