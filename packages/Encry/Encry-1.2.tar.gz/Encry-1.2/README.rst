You can the use it as you would a normal command
	$ Encry.py -e test -d
	this meanse encrypt(-e) the message(test) with the default key(-d)
	you can get a randomly generated key with -r
	to decrypt do:
	<code>
		$ Encry.py --entry 1 -d
	</code>
		 this means look for entry(1) in output.txt and decrypt it(-d)

You can also use this as a python module, simply type:
