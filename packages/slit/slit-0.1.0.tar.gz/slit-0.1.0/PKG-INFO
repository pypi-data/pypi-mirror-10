Description: slit - *sequential lit*
        =======================
        
        About
        -----
        
        slit, or *sequential lit*, is a literate programming tool for creating
        compelling, accurate software tutorials with minimal effort.
        
        slit borrows from the school of literate programming, where programs are
        generated from their own documentation. However, where other tools focus
        on *what* a program is, slit focuses on *how* a program is written, and
        provides a richer syntax for expressing the *sequence* of a program's
        creation from start to finish.
        
        In doing so, slit turns literate programming into an unstoppable tool
        for creating compelling, provably accurate programming tutorials.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Total control of code and documentation structure *in time*
        
        -  Carefully document every single step, including wrong turns,
           backtracking, and extending existing code
        
        -  Generate **working**, complex, multi-file, multi-language program
           examples from a single tutorial
        
        -  Output shell commands directly into your documentation to show the
           progression of a program
        
        Who uses slit?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  slit is at the core of the `LameStation programming
           tutorials <http://www.lamestation.com/learn/demos/latest/03_maps/01_DrawingMaps.spin.html>`__
           (in development).
        
        -  The README you are reading right now is generated with
           ``./slit -ds README.lit``.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ``slit`` is a single python script and has been tested with Python 2.7.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        While trying to keep new syntax to a minimum, slit adds some extremely
        useful features that are hard to find.
        
        Basics
        ~~~~~~
        
        slit uses markdown for its documentation format, but works with any
        programming language.
        
        slit files should be marked with with ``.lit`` extension, appended to
        the regular file extension.
        
        ::
        
            hello_world.c.lit
        
        slit works by allow you to assemble code into separate containers, then
        building your document from them.
        
        Code containers are marked with the ``<< blockname >>=`` syntax on a
        line by itself. They must be indented to be accepted as code macros.
        
        ::
        
            Here is our hello world example!
        
                << main >=
                int main (void)
                {
                    printf("hello world!\n");
                }
        
        The code block will end when the indent level returns to 0.
        
        ::
        
                    printf("hello world!\n");
                }
        
            The code block is over!
        
        Basic macros
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There are three core elements that make up slit syntax.
        
        -  Macro assignment - ``<< NAME >>=``
        
        -  Macro append - ``<< NAME >>+=``
        
        -  Macro value - ``<< NAME >>``
        
        append macro
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The append macro (``<< NAME >>+=``) allows you to add code to the end of
        a new or existing container, where ``NAME`` is the container name.
        
        assignment macro
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The assignment macro (``<< NAME >>=``) will add code to a new or
        existing container, overwriting what was already in it, where ``NAME``
        is the container name.
        
        container names
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Contain names can be one of the following
        
        -  Named containers, containing alphanumeric characters and underscores,
           like ``codeblock1``, ``main_function``.
        
        -  File containers, containing a single-word filename with extension,
           like ``filename.txt`` (*files with spaces or that reside in a
           different path are not currently supported*)
        
        -  The ``*`` container, which will create a file named after the
           top-level slit file with the ``.lit`` extension removed. So for
           ``hello_world.c.lit``, the ``*`` container will generate the
           ``hello_world.c`` code file.
        
        The top-level documentation file is always generated at the source file
        name with a ``.md`` extension, so ``hello_world.c.lit`` will generate
        ``hello_world.c.md``
        
        Include directive
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Use the ``#include`` directive to organize a single tutorial into
        multiple files.
        
        ::
        
            #include "part1.spin"
            #include "part1.diagram"
            #include "part2.spin"
            #include "part2.diagram"
            #include "gfx_cave.lit"
            #include "conclusion.md"
        
        Shell commands
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        **WARNING: this WILL allow tutorials to execute commands directly on
        your system. Use with caution.**
        
        Use the shell macro (``<<#! command >>``) to dump the output of shell
        commands into your tutorial.
        
        Watch the output of the ``<<#! tree test/ >>`` command.
        
        ::
        
            $ tree test/
            test/
            ├── bacon
            ├── chicken
            └── turkey
        
            0 directories, 3 files
        
        This feature is inherently platform and build environment dependent and
        will make your tutorial build less portable. Use wisely!
        
        This feature is disabled by default. Enable with ``-s``.

        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        For a complete listing of slit parameters, use ``--help``:
        
        ::
        
            $ ./slit --help

              PATH               path to lit file to process (dir or file)
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help         show this help message and exit
              -c, --code         build final source file
              -d, --doc          build markdown documentation
              -s, --shell        enable shell code execution
              --build-directory  scan directory and build every literate file

        ------
        
        slit is created by Brett Weir, and inspired by Connor Osborne's
        `lit <https://github.com/cdosborn/lit>`__ tool and Donald Knuth, for
        coming up with literate programming in the first place.
