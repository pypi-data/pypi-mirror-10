        NearSide
        ========
        Because we make more sense than The Far Side.
        
        Description: a package for processing antenna near-field data.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        **Ubuntu:**
        
        NearSide uses NumPy so you need to decide if you want to build it yourself with
        
            $ sudo pip install numpy
        
        or download the package with
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
        
        I have been building NumPy using the pip method, but it takes a long time. 
        
        Once you have NumPy, install NearSide with 
        
            $ sudo pip install nearside (COMMING SOON)
            
        **Windows:**
        Make sure you have Numpy on your machine, then
        
            $ pip install nearside (COMMING SOON)
