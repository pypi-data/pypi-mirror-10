Note about NumPy:

    NumPy is a necessary part of NearSide, but there are many ways to install
    it. On Ubuntu you can install the the python-numpy package with apt-get or
    use pip, and on Windows you can use full systems like Anaconda, download
    wheels from unofficial sites, or if you have the compilers for the right 
    version of the Python distribution you can build it yourself. Since there
    are so many ways to get NumPy, I think I will require people to install
    and update it themselves and not put it in the requirements here.
