Description: # smtpsink
        
        An SMTP sink.  It accepts all email (with a list of addresses to reject)
        and then saves them to a file.  At no time does it send any emails.
        
        A web UI allows the user to review when emails were received and a REST
        API allows the user to programmatically check the same info.
