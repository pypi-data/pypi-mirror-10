        Check a site for spelling errors in a way that can be integrated with your testing
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I wanted a way to add spellchecking to a suite of tests for a Flask-based
        site.  I saw some windows tools, using a combination of lynx/curl/wget and
        i/a/hunspell.
        
        But I just want a way to get a +/- test and a list of misspelled words.
        
        How
        ---
        
        So sitechantment is a command line utility to do just that.  You can pass it a url
        to crawl, an optional additional list of words, language, etc.  It will crawl the
        site (not wandering off to another host/port) spellcheck every page and give you a
        list of words that are "misspelled".
        
        You have the ability to run with a --update flag to automatically add all words to
        a personal word list so they aren't flagged on the next run.
        
        It is also available as a class sitechantment.SiteCheck, that can be used inside a
        test suite.  You can even pass it a flask test client instead of using requests
        and be able to crawl a site inside of py.test or whatever is being used to unit
        test a flask application.  (Really anything can be used as long as it supports
        handling uri's with a get() method).
