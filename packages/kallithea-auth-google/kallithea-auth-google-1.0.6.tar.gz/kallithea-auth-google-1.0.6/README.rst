Installation
============

::

    pip install kallithea-auth-google

In the Kallithea ``Authentication`` settings, add ``kallithea_auth_google.auth_google``, save, then set the settings.

In your config (``my.ini``):

::

    ## google auth middleware
    [filter:google-auth]
    use = egg:kallithea-auth-google#google-auth

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline =
        google-auth
        kallithea

    [app:kallithea]
    use = egg:Kallithea#main

Note that after this change, for ``paster setup-db`` you'll need to pass the section name explicitly:

::

    paster setup-db my.ini#kallithea
