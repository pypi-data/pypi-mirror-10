SL Fortigate Order and Configuration Tool
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This tool can order a Fortigate firewall on an existing VLAN, a new VLAN, or can reconfigure an existing device.

Usage
-----

.. code-block::

   usage: slfortigate [-h] [-d datacenter] [--vlan protectedvlan] [--ha-pair]
                     [-o file] [--really-order] [--config-existing hostname]
                     [-v]

   Order and configure a fortigate security appliance, locking down the vlan by default, so that all subsequent
      servers ordered on this vlan will be protected immediately.

   optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -d datacenter, --datacenter datacenter
                          the datacenter to create this fortigate in. Use the
                          short name of the datacenter, e.g. sjc01. Use this
                          option instead of --vlan when you do not have any
                          servers in this datacenter yet. A small VSI will
                          automatically be created to get a public vlan and the
                          fortigate put on that vlan.
    --vlan protectedvlan  the existing VLAN to be protected by the fortigate,
                          specified as <vlanNum>.<routerHostname>, for example,
                          1738.fcr01a.tor01. Either this argument or
                          --datacenter must be specified.
    --ha-pair             not yet implemented! You want to order 2 fortigates
                          configured together as an HA pair
    -o file, --output file
                          file name to put the order or quote output in, instead
                          of displaying it to stdout. The order/quote data
                          structure is very large, so you will probably want it
                          in a file.
    --really-order        really order the fortigate, otherwise just get a quote
    --config-existing hostname
                          the hostname of an existing fortigate to configure
                          instead of ordering a new fortigate
    -v, --verbose         display verbose output

   In addition to the options below, you also need to set environment variables
      SL_USERNAME and SL_API_KEY, or have them in your ~/.softlayer file.

      EXAMPLES:

      # Order a fortigate security appliance in a new datacenter:
      slfortigate -d tor01 --output ~/tmp/order.txt --really-order

      # Order a fortigate security appliance on a specific VLAN:
      slfortigate --vlan 1275.fcr01a.tor01 --output ~/tmp/order.txt --really-order

      # Configure an existing fortigate security appliance:
      slfortigate --config-existing firewall-vlan1729.networklayer.com


System Requirements
-------------------

* This library has been tested on Python 2.7 on RHEL 7.
* A valid SoftLayer API username and key are required to call SoftLayer's API.
