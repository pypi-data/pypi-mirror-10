Description: Automate is a general purpose Python automatization library. Its objective is to offer convenient and robust object-oriented programming framework for complex state machine systems. Automate can be used to design complex automation systems, yet it is easy to learn and fun to use. It was originally developed with home robotics/automatization projects in mind, but is quite general in nature and could find applications from various fields. Automate can be embedded in other Python software as a component, which runs its operation in its own threads.
