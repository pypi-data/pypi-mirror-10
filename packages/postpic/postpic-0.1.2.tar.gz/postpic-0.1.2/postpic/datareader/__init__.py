'''
The Datareader package contains methods and interfaces to read data from
any Simulation.

The basic concept consits of two different types of readers:

The Dumpreader
--------------
This has to be subclassed from Dumpreader_ifc and allows to read a single dump
created by the simulation. To identify which dump should be read its
initialized with a dumpidentifier. This dumpidentifier can be almost anything,
but in the easiest case this is the filepath pointing to a single file
containing every information about this simulation dump. With this information
the dumpreader must be able to read all data regarding this dump (which is a
lot: X, Y, Z, Px, Py, Py, weight, mass, charge, ID,.. for all particle species,
electric and magnetic fields on grid, the grid itself, mabe particle ids,...)

The Simulationreader
--------------------
This has to be subclassed from Simulationreader_ifc and allows to read a full
list of simulation dumps. Thus an alternate Name for this class could be
"Dumpsequence". This allows the code to track particles from different times
of the simulation or create plots with a time axis.

class Dumpreader_ifc(FieldAnalyzer):
    '''
    Interface class for reading a single dump. A dump contains informations
    about the  simulation at a single timestep (Usually E- and B-Fields on
    grid + particles).

    Any Dumpreader_ifc implementation will always be initialized using a
    dumpidentifier. This dumpidentifier can be anything, that points to
    the data of a dump. In the easiest case this is just the filename of
    the dump holding all data of that timestep
    (for example .sdf file for EPOCH, .hdf5 for some other code).

    The dumpreader should provide all necessary informations in a unified interface
    but at the same time it should not restrict the user to these properties of there
    dump only. The recommended implementation is shown here (EPOCH and VSim reader
    work like this):
    All (!) data, that is saved in a single dump should be accessible via the
    self.__getitem__(key) method. Together with the self.keys() method, this will ensure,
    that every dumpreader works as a dictionary and every dump attribute is accessible
    via this dictionary.

    All other functions, which provide a unified interface should just point to the
    right key. If some attribute wasnt dumped a KeyError must be thrown. This allows
    classes which are using the reader to just exit if a needed property wasnt dumped
    or to catch the KeyError and proceed by actively ignoring it.

    It is highly recommended to also override the __str__ function.

    Args:
      dumpidentifier : variable type
        whatever identifies the dump. It is recommended to use a String
        here pointing to a file.
